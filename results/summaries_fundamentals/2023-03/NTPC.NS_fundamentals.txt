Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY.

Here's a brief justification:

* The forward PE (13.85) is lower than the trailing PE (16.39), indicating that the stock is expected to grow in the future.
* The ROE (13.45%) is decent, indicating that the company is generating sufficient returns on its equity.
* The profit margin (12.45%) is also respectable, indicating that the company has a good control over its costs.
* The revenue growth (4.6%) and earnings growth (23.4%) are both positive, indicating a strong fundamental outlook for the company.
* Although the debt-to-equity ratio is high, the utilities sector is capital-intensive, and this is partly justified.

Overall, the company appears to have a good fundamental outlook, and the stock is relatively undervalued based on its forward PE. Hence, a BUY rating is recommended.
