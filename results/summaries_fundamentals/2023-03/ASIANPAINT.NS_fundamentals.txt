Based on the data, I would recommend SELL for the stock. Here's why:

* High trailing and forward P/E ratios indicate that the stock is overvalued relative to its earnings.
* Low ROE and profit margin suggest that the company is not efficiently using its resources to generate profits.
* Negative revenue and earnings growth rates indicate that the company is not performing well in terms of growth.
* High debt-to-equity ratio implies that the company is heavily leveraged, which increases the risk of default.

Overall, the stock appears to be overvalued and the company is not performing well in terms of growth and profitability, making it a good option to sell.
