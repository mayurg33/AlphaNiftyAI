Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing and forward P/E ratios are high, indicating that the stock may be overvalued.
* The ROE is relatively low, suggesting that the company may not be generating sufficient returns on shareholders' equity.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high, which could indicate a higher risk profile for the company.
* However, the revenue growth and earnings growth rates are promising, suggesting that the company may have a strong potential for future growth.

Overall, while there are some positive signs, the high P/E ratios and low ROE are concerns that lead me to recommend a HOLD rather than a BUY.
