I would recommend a SELL for Coal India Limited. Here's why:

* The company is in a declining industry (thermal coal) which is expected to continue its downward trend.
* Revenue growth and earnings growth are both negative, indicating a struggling business.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high at 9.15, which raises concerns about the company's ability to service its debt.
* While the trailing PE is low, the forward PE is high, suggesting that the market is pricing in a turnaround that may not materialize.

Given these factors, it's likely that the stock price will continue to decline, making it a sell.
