Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD for ITC Limited. Here's why:

* The trailing PE is slightly higher than the industry average, indicating that the stock may be slightly overvalued. However, the forward PE is more reasonable, indicating that the market expects the company's earnings to improve in the future.
* The ROE is decent, suggesting that the company is generating sufficient returns on its shareholders' equity.
* The profit margin is high, which is a positive sign for a consumer defensive stock.
* The revenue growth is slow, but the earnings growth is relatively strong, indicating that the company is able to maintain its profitability despite the slow revenue growth.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, indicating that the company has a decent balance sheet.

Overall, while the stock may not be extremely undervalued, it has a decent balance sheet, strong profit margins, and reasonable growth prospects. Therefore, a HOLD rating is justified.
