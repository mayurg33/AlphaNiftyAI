Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD for IndusInd Bank Limited. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing PE of 25.57 suggests that the market has already priced in some growth expectations, which might be challenging to achieve given the revenue growth rate of -0.82%.
* However, the forward PE of 8.74 indicates that the market expects a correction or a slowdown in growth, which might provide a buying opportunity if the bank can demonstrate a turnaround in its revenue growth.
* The ROE of 4.02% is decent, but not exceptional, suggesting that the bank needs to focus on improving its earnings.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is not provided, but a "None" value might indicate a relatively low debt burden, which is a positive.

Overall, while there are some concerns around revenue growth and profitability, the forward PE suggests that the market has already priced in some of the negative expectations. Therefore, a HOLD rating seems appropriate, pending further developments and guidance from the bank's management.
