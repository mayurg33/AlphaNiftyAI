Based on the data, I would recommend SELL for the stock. Here's why:

* The trailing PE is relatively low, but the forward PE is high, indicating that the market expects a significant increase in earnings, which may not be achievable given the negative revenue and earnings growth.
* The ROE is low, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient profits from its equity.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high, which may indicate a high level of financial risk.
* The negative revenue and earnings growth indicates that the company's financial performance is deteriorating.

Overall, the stock may not be a good investment opportunity at this time.
