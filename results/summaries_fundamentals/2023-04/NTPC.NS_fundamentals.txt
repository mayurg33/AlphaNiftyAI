Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing PE ratio is relatively high at 16.39, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. However, the forward PE ratio is lower at 13.85, suggesting that the market expects earnings to grow.
* The ROE is moderate at 13.45%, indicating that the company is generating decent returns on its equity.
* The profit margin is low at 12.45%, which may be a concern, but the earnings growth rate is quite high at 23.4%, which suggests that the company is doing well in terms of profitability.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high at 130.86, which indicates that the company has a significant amount of debt. However, this is not uncommon in the utilities sector.

Overall, while there are some concerns around valuation and debt, the company's earnings growth and profitability trend suggest that it's not a clear SELL candidate. However, the valuation is not extremely attractive either, so I wouldn't recommend a BUY at this point. A HOLD would be a more prudent approach.
