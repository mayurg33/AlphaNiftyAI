Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's why:

* The forward PE of 26.46 is lower than the trailing PE of 35.69, indicating that the market expects the company's earnings to increase in the future.
* The ROE of 15.48% is decent, indicating that the company is generating a good return on its equity.
* The earnings growth rate of 76.4% is very strong, suggesting that the company's profitability is increasing rapidly.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a bit high, but it's not excessively high, indicating that the company has a manageable debt burden.

Overall, the company's strong earnings growth, decent ROE, and lower forward PE make it an attractive investment opportunity.
