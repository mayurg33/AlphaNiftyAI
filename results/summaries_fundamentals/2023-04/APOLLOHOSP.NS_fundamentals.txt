Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing PE of 68.77 is slightly high, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. However, the healthcare industry is known for its defensive nature, which can justify a premium valuation to some extent.
* The forward PE of 85.03 is even higher, which may indicate that the market is pricing in high growth expectations. While the earnings growth rate of 53.5% is impressive, it may not be sustainable in the long term.
* The ROE of 18.85% is decent, but the profit margin of 6.63% is relatively low. This indicates that the operating efficiency of the company may be a concern.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89 is high and may be a red flag. High debt levels can increase the risk of default and negatively impact the company's credit rating.

Overall, while Apollo Hospitals has some positive characteristics, such as its earnings growth and decent ROE, the high valuation, low profit margin, and high debt levels are concerns that justify a HOLD recommendation. Further analysis is needed to determine if the company's growth prospects can justify its valuation and overcome its weaknesses.
