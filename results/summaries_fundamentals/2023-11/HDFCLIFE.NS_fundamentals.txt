Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD. Here's why:

* The trailing PE is high (91.09) and the forward PE is even higher (122.03), which suggests that the stock is overvalued.
* The ROE is low (11.75%) and the profit margin is also low (1.86%), which indicates that the company is not generating high profits from its sales.
* The revenue growth is negative (-13.8%) which is a concern, but the earnings growth is positive (15.9%), which suggests that it's able to maintain its earnings despite declining revenue.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is moderate (18.26) which may indicate that the company is not over-leveraged.

Given these mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD and monitor the company's performance closely. If the revenue growth improves and profitability increases, it could be a BUY.
