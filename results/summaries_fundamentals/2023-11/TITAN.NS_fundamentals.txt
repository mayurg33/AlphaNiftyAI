Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

1. **Overvaluation**: The trailing PE is 91.4, which is extremely high, indicating that the stock is overpriced.
2. **High debt**: The debt-to-equity ratio is 178.7, which is alarmingly high, suggesting that the company may struggle to meet its debt obligations.
3. **Low profit margin**: The ROE is 0.31755, which indicates that the company is generating sufficient profits from its operations.
4. **Slowing growth**: The revenue growth rate is 0.194, and earnings growth rate is 0.131, which suggests that the company's growth momentum is slowing down.

Given these factors, I would recommend selling the shares and exploring alternative investment opportunities with better growth potential and less debt burden.
