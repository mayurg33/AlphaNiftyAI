Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing PE (68.77) and forward PE (85.03) are high, indicating that the stock is already factored into the current price, leaving limited upside.
* ROE (18.85%) and Profit Margin (6.63%) are moderate, suggesting that the company's profitability is not outstanding.
* Revenue Growth (13.1%) and Earnings Growth (53.5%) are positive, indicating a decent growth trajectory.
* The high Debt/Equity ratio (90.89) raises some concerns about the financial health of the company.

Overall, while the growth prospects are encouraging, the high PE multiples and mediocre profitability metrics suggest that the stock may not have significant upside in the near term. Hence, a HOLD recommendation seems appropriate.
