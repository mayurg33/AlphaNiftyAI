Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY.

The reasons are:

1. The forward PE ratio of 8.718161 is significantly lower than the trailing PE ratio of 25.507423, indicating that the stock is undervalued.
2. The ROE of 0.04023 and profit margin of 0.13149999 are decent, indicating that the company is profitable.
3. The absence of debt/equity ratio suggests that the company has a clean balance sheet.

The negative revenue growth is a concern, but considering the low forward PE ratio and clean balance sheet, I believe the stock has upside potential.
