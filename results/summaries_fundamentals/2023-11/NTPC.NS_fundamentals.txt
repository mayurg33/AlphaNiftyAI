Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD. Here's a brief justification:

* The PE ratios (trailing and forward) are not overly expensive, suggesting that the stock is not stretched.
* The ROE is moderate, indicating that the company is generating reasonable returns on its capital.
* The revenue growth is slow, but earnings growth is decent, implying that the company is managing its costs effectively.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high, which could be a concern. However, given the regulated nature of the utility sector, this might be a manageable risk.

Overall, while there are no compelling reasons to buy or sell the stock, the HOLD recommendation is a cautious approach, taking into account the mixed signals from the data.
