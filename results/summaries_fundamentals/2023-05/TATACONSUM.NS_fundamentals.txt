Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's why:

* The revenue growth rate of 17.3% and earnings growth rate of 53.1% suggest that the company is experiencing strong top-line and bottom-line growth.
* The profit margin of 7.3% indicates that the company is able to maintain a decent level of profitability.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 11.19 is manageable, indicating that the company's leverage is not a concern.
* Although the trailing PE is high at 81.49, the forward PE of 71.29 indicates that the market expects the company's earnings growth to continue, making the stock relatively more attractive.

Overall, the company's strong growth prospects, decent profitability, and manageable debt levels make it an attractive investment opportunity.
