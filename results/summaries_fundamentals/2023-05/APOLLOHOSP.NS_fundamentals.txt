Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD.

Reasons:

* High trailing PE (68.73) and forward PE (84.98) indicate that the stock is already priced high, leaving limited room for upside.
* ROE (18.85%) is decent but not outstanding, suggesting that the company's profitability is fair but not exceptional.
* Debt/Equity ratio of 90.89, indicating high leverage, which could be a concern in case of a downturn.

However, there are some positives:

* Revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%) are strong, indicating a growing business.

Overall, the stock appears to be fairly valued, and I would recommend a HOLD, rather than a BUY or SELL, to monitor the company's progress and wait for a potential correction or improvement in fundamentals.
