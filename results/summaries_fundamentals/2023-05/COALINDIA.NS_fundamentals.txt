Based on the data, I would recommend SELL for the stock of Coal India Limited. Here's why:

* The company is in a sector that is increasingly being negatively impacted by environmental concerns and regulations, which could lead to a decline in its market share and profitability.
* The trailing PE ratio is relatively low, but the forward PE ratio is significantly higher, suggesting that the market is pricing in a significant improvement in earnings, which may not materialize given the negative revenue and earnings growth rates.
* The ROE is relatively low, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. The debt-to-equity ratio is also high, which could be a concern.
* The profit margin is reasonable, but the revenue and earnings growth rates are negative, suggesting that the company's financial performance is deteriorating.

Overall, the combination of a declining industry, poor financial performance, and high debt levels make it difficult to recommend a buy or hold rating for Coal India Limited stock.
