Based on the provided data, I would recommend a HOLD for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited. Here's a brief justification:

* The company's trailing and forward P/E ratios are relatively low, indicating that the stock may be undervalued compared to its earnings.
* The ROE is around 10%, indicating that the company is not generating high returns on its equity.
* Revenue growth is modest, but earnings growth is negative, which is a concern.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which may indicate that the company is heavily leveraged and may struggle to meet its debt obligations.

Given these mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD and monitor the company's performance closely, especially its ability to improve its earnings and reduce its debt burden.
