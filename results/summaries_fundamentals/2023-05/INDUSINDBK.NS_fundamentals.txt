Based on the provided data, I would recommend a BUY.

The reasons are:

1. The forward PE of 8.74 is significantly lower than the trailing PE of 25.56, indicating that the stock is undervalued.
2. The ROE of 4.02% and profit margin of 13.15% indicate that the company is profitable and has a decent margin.
3. Although the revenue growth is -0.822, the earnings growth is none, which means the earnings are stable.

However, it's worth noting that the debt-to-equity ratio is not available, which could be a potential risk. Additionally, the company is in the regional banking industry, which can be subject to regulatory changes and economic fluctuations.

Overall, considering the low forward PE and decent profitability, I would recommend a BUY. However, it's essential to conduct further research and consider other factors before making a final investment decision.
