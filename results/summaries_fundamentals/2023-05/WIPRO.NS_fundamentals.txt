Based on the data, I would recommend BUY for Wipro Limited. Here's a brief justification:

1. **Attractive Valuation**: The forward PE of 10.34 is lower than the trailing PE of 20.90, indicating that the stock is undervalued** compared to its historical performance.
2. **Strong Earnings Growth**: The earnings growth rate of 25.1% is higher than the revenue growth rate, indicating that the company is able to convert its revenue growth into earnings growth.
3. **Decent Profit Margin**: The profit margin of 14.74% is healthy and indicates that the company is able to keep a significant portion of its revenue as profit.
4. **Reasonable Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 23.12 is not alarmingly high, suggesting that the company has a relatively healthy balance sheet.

Overall, the attractive valuation, strong earnings growth, decent profit margin, and a healthy balance sheet make a compelling case for Wipro Limited, leading me to suggest a BUY recommendation.
