Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

* The trailing PE of 36.13 is already stretched, and the forward PE of 50.36 is even more concerning, indicating that the market is pricing in high growth expectations that may not be realistic.
* ROE of 15.71% is respectable, but not exceptional, especially considering the debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26, which suggests that the company is relying heavily on debt to finance its operations and growth.
* The profit margin of 20.79% is decent, but the revenue growth rate of 8.1% and the earnings growth rate of -18.8% are concerning, indicating that the top line and bottom line are not growing at a healthy rate.
* Overall, the stock appears to be expensive, with a low growth rate and high debt levels, making it a SELL.
