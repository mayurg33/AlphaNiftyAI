Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL for the stock. Here's why:

* The trailing and forward PE multiples are relatively low, but the profit margin and earnings growth are negative, indicating that the company is struggling to generate profits.
* The revenue growth is also negative, indicating a decline in sales.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high at 75.077, which raises concerns about the company's ability to manage its debt and meet its obligations.
* The return on equity (ROE) is relatively low at 16.99%, which suggests that the company is not generating sufficient returns for its shareholders.

Overall, the company's financials suggest that it is struggling to generate profits and is heavily leveraged, which are red flags for investors. Therefore, I would recommend a SELL for the stock.
