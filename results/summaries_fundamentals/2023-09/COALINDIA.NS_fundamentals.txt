I would recommend a SELL for Coal India Limited. Here's why:

* The ROE is low at 0.3847, which indicates that the company is not generating sufficient profits from its shareholders' equity.
* The profit margin is also low at 0.27851, indicating that the company's profit from its sales is not substantial.
* The revenue growth and earnings growth are both negative, suggesting that the company's sales and profits are declining.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is high at 9.15, indicating that the company is heavily reliant on debt financing, which can be risky.

Overall, these metrics suggest that Coal India Limited is not performing well financially, and therefore, I would recommend a SELL.
