Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing PE of 31.30833 is relatively high, but the forward PE of 26.045708 indicates that the stock is expected to grow and the PE ratio will decrease, making the stock relatively attractive.
* The ROE of 0.24068001 indicates that the company is generating a good return on shareholder's equity, which is a positive sign.
* The profit margin of 0.23466998 is healthy, indicating that the company is able to maintain a good profit margin despite being in a competitive industry.
* The revenue growth and earnings growth rates are both positive, indicating that the company is growing and is expected to continue growing in the future.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is 2.151, which is a bit on the higher side, but considering the other positive factors, I would still recommend a SELL.

Overall, the stock seems to be a good buy at the current levels, given its growth prospects, healthy financials, and attractive valuation.
