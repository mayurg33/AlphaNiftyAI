Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's why:

* The forward PE of 13.83 is lower than the trailing PE of 16.38, indicating that the stock is undervalued.
* The ROE of 13.45% is decent, indicating that the company is generating sufficient profits from its equity.
* The profit margin of 12.45% is healthy, indicating that the company is able to maintain its profitability.
* The earnings growth rate of 23.4% is impressive, indicating that the company's earnings are expected to increase significantly in the future.
* Although the debt-to-equity ratio is high at 130.86, it is not uncommon for utility companies to have high debt levels.

Overall, the stock appears to be undervalued, with a strong earnings growth trajectory, making it a good BUY opportunity.
