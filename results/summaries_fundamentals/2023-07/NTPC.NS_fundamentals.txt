Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's why:

* The forward PE of 13.84 is lower than the trailing PE of 16.39, indicating potential undervaluation.
* The profit margin of 12.45% and ROE of 13.45% are decent, indicating a profitable business.
* The revenue growth of 4.6% and earnings growth of 23.4% are positive, indicating a growing business.
* While the debt-to-equity ratio of 130.86 is high, it's not excessively alarming for a utility company.

Overall, the stock appears to be undervalued with a decent track record of profitability and growth, making it a BUY recommendation.
