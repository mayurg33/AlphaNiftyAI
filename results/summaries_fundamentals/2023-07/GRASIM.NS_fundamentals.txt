Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL for the stock. Here's why:

1. **High PE ratios**: Both trailing and forward PE ratios are high, indicating that the stock is overvalued. This could lead to a correction in the price.
2. **Low ROE**: Return on Equity (ROE) is low, indicating that the company is generating a low return on shareholders' equity, which is a concern.
3. **High Debt-to-Equity ratio**: The high debt-to-equity ratio indicates that the company is heavily leveraged, which can increase the risk of default and negatively impact the stock price.
5. **Slow earnings growth**: Earnings growth is slow, which may not justify the high PE ratio.

While revenue growth is positive, it's not strong enough to outweigh the concerns mentioned above. Therefore, I would recommend a SELL for the Grasim Industries Limited stock.
