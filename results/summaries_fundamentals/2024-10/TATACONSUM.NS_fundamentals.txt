Based on the provided data, I would recommend a HOLD for Tata Consumer Products Limited. Here's my thought process:

1. **Valuation**: The trailing PE of 84.62 and forward PE of 74.14 indicate that the stock is trading at a premium. This suggests that the market has high expectations from the company, and the stock may not be undervalued. However, the premium valuation doesn't necessarily mean it's overvalued, given the company's strong financial performance.

2. **Financial Performance**: The ROE of 6.63% and profit margin of 7.26% are relatively healthy, indicating that the company is generating decent profits from its operations.

3. **Growth Prospects**: The revenue growth of 17.3% and earnings growth of 53.1% are impressive, suggesting that the company is experiencing strong top-line and bottom-line growth. This growth momentum is likely to continue, supporting the stock's valuation.

4. **Leverage**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 11.19 is relatively high, which could be a concern. However, given the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects, it's likely that the company can manage its debt effectively.

Overall, while the stock may not be undervalued, its strong financial performance and growth prospects justify the current valuation. Therefore, I would recommend a HOLD, as the stock is likely to continue performing well in the short to medium term. However, I would keep a close eye on the company's debt levels and interest coverage ratio to ensure that the debt is not becoming a burden.
