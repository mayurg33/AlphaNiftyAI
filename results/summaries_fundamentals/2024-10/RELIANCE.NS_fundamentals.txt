Based on the provided data, here's my recommendation:

**HOLD**

Chain of thoughts:

1. **Valuation**: The trailing PE of 28.21 is relatively high compared to the forward PE of 20.19, which suggests that the market expects the company's earnings to improve in the future. This might indicate that the stock is currently overvalued.

2. **Profitability**: The ROE of 8.4% is decent, but the profit margin of 7.22% is somewhat mediocre for an oil and gas refining company. This could be a concern, especially if the company faces intense competition or declining prices.

3. **Growth**: The revenue growth rate of 10.5% is healthy, but the earnings growth rate of 2.4% is relatively low. This disparity could indicate that the company is struggling to convert its revenue growth into profit growth.

4. **Leverage**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 36.61 is moderately high, which might increase the company's financial risk and affect its ability to pay dividends or invest in growth opportunities.

Considering these factors, I would recommend a **HOLD** position. While the company's revenue growth is impressive, its profitability and earnings growth are concerning. Additionally, the stock appears to be overvalued, and the high debt-to-equity ratio adds to the uncertainty. Therefore, it's best to hold the stock for now and monitor its performance closely before making a buy or sell decision.
