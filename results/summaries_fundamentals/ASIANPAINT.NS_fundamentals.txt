I would recommend SELL. Here's why:

* The PEs (59.1 and 80.1) are quite high, indicating that the stock is overvalued.
* The ROE (18.79%) is decent but not spectacular, and the profit margin (10.83%) is relatively thin.
* Both revenue growth (-3.33%) and earnings growth (-44.9%) are negative, indicating a declining trend.
* The debt-to-equity ratio (11.42) is moderate, but not a major concern.

Overall, the stock appears to be expensive, with declining growth prospects. Therefore, I would recommend selling the stock.
