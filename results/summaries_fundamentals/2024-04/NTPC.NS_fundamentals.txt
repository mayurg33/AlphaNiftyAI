Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's why:

* The forward PE of 13.81 is lower than the trailing PE of 16.34, indicating that the stock is undervalued.
* The ROE of 13.45% and profit margin of 12.45% are respectable, indicating a profitable business.
* Revenue growth of 4.6% and earnings growth of 23.4% are positive, indicating a growing business.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 130.86 is a bit high, but it's manageable for a utility company.

Overall, the stock appears to be undervalued, with a strong growth profile, making it a good buy opportunity.
