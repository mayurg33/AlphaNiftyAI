Let's break down the analysis step by step:

**Valuation:**
The trailing PE of 16.21 is slightly higher than the forward PE of 13.70, suggesting that the market expects the company's earnings to grow in the future. This is a positive sign.

**Profitability:**
The ROE of 13.45% is decent, indicating that the company is generating sufficient profits from its equity. The profit margin of 12.45% is also respectable, considering the utility sector's typically low margins.

**Growth:**
The revenue growth rate of 4.6% is moderate, while the earnings growth rate of 23.4% is impressive. This suggests that the company is able to increase its profitability despite moderate revenue growth.

**Debt:**
The debt-to-equity ratio of 130.86 is concerning, as it indicates high leverage. However, utility companies often have high debt levels due to their capital-intensive nature.

**Recommendation:**
Considering the decent profitability, strong earnings growth, and relatively attractive valuation, I would recommend **BUY**. Although the debt level is high, the utility sector's stable cash flows can support high debt levels. Overall, the company's growth prospects and relatively low forward PE make it an attractive investment opportunity.
