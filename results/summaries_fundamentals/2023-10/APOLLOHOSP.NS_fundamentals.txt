Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD.

The company has a high profit margin (6.63%) and strong earnings growth (53.5%), indicating a healthy financial performance. The revenue growth (13.1%) is also respectable. However, the ROE (18.85%) is relatively low, suggesting that the company may not be utilizing its assets efficiently.

Furthermore, the debt-to-equity ratio (90.89) is quite high, which may be a concern as it indicates a high level of leverage. The trailing PE (68.70) and forward PE (84.94) are also higher than the industry average, suggesting that the stock may be overvalued.

Overall, while the company's financial performance is good, the high debt level and high PE ratios are cautionary flags. Therefore, I would recommend a HOLD until the company addresses its high leverage and the stock's valuation becomes more reasonable.
