Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY for IndusInd Bank Limited. Here's why:

* The forward PE ratio of 8.72 is significantly lower than the trailing PE ratio, indicating that the stock is undervalued and has potential for growth.
* The ROE of 4.02% is decent, indicating that the company is generating reasonable returns on its equity.
* Although revenue growth is negative, it is likely to be a temporary setback, and the company's profit margin of 13.15% suggests that it has the ability to maintain profitability despite revenue decline.

Overall, considering the undervaluation, decent ROE, and profitability, I would recommend a BUY for long-term investors.
