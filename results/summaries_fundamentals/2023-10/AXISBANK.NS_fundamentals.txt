Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD for Axis Bank Limited. Here's why:

* The trailing PE of 13.51 is slightly above the industry average, but the forward PE of 11.69 indicates that the stock is expected to grow at a reasonable pace in the future.
* The ROE of 16.32% is decent and indicates that the management is generating good returns on shareholders' equity.
* The profit margin of 36.57% is very high, indicating that the bank's operations are profitable.
* The revenue growth of 8.66% is stable, but the earnings growth of -6.66% is a concern.

Overall, while there are some positive factors, the negative earnings growth is a concern. I would recommend a HOLD until more clarity emerges on the earnings growth front.
