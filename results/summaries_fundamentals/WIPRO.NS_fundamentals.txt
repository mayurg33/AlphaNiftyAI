Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's a brief justification:

1. **Attractive Valuation**: The forward PE ratio of 10.35 is significantly lower than the trailing PE ratio of 20.92, indicating that the stock is undervalued and has room for growth.
3. **Strong Earnings Growth**: The earnings growth rate of 25.1% is impressive, suggesting that the company is likely to continue to increase its profitability.
4. **Conservative Leverage**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 23.12 is relatively low, indicating that the company has a conservative capital structure and is less vulnerable to financial distress.

Overall, the combination of attractive valuation, strong earnings growth, and conservative leverage makes Wipro Limited an attractive investment opportunity.
