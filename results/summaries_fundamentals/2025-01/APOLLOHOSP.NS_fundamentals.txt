Here's my thought process and recommendation:

**Step 1: Industry and Market Cap**
The healthcare industry is generally considered defensive and stable, which is a positive. The market cap is large, indicating a well-established company.

**Step 2: Valuation**
The trailing PE is high at 69.42, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The forward PE is even higher at 85.86, suggesting that the market expects high growth in the future. This could be a concern if the company doesn't meet these expectations.

**Step 3: Profitability**
The ROE is decent at 18.84%, indicating that the company is generating profits from its equity. However, the profit margin is relatively low at 6.63%, which may suggest that the company operates in a competitive industry or has high costs.

**Step 4: Growth**
Revenue growth is moderate at 13.1%, while earnings growth is strong at 53.5%. This suggests that the company is able to convert its revenue growth into earnings growth, which is a positive.

**Step 5: Leverage**
The debt-to-equity ratio is high at 90.89, indicating that the company has significant debt. This could be a concern if interest rates rise or if the company's cash flows are impacted.

**Overall Assessment**
Based on the analysis, I would recommend a HOLD rating for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited. While the company has strong earnings growth and operates in a defensive industry, the high valuation multiples and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The low profit margin also suggests that the company may not have a significant competitive advantage. Overall, I would hold the stock and monitor its performance to see if it can justify its high valuation multiples.
