Based on the provided data, here's my thought process and recommendation:

1. **Valuation**: The trailing PE ratio of 34.99 is slightly higher than the industry average, indicating that the stock might be slightly overvalued. However, the forward PE ratio of 25.93 is more reasonable, suggesting that the market expects the company's earnings to grow in the future.

2. **Profitability**: The ROE (Return on Equity) of 15.48% is decent, indicating that the company is generating a reasonable return on its shareholders' equity. The profit margin of 8.02% is also acceptable, given the industry average.

3. **Growth**: The revenue growth rate of 4% is slow, but the earnings growth rate of 76.4% is impressive, indicating that the company is doing a good job of converting its revenue into profits.

4. **Debt**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is high, which could be a concern. However, it's not excessively high, and the company's ability to generate profits and grow its earnings should help it service its debt.

Considering these factors, I would recommend a **HOLD** on Tech Mahindra Limited. While the stock might be slightly overvalued, the company's profitability and earnings growth are promising. However, the slow revenue growth and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns that need to be monitored. If the company can sustain its earnings growth and improve its revenue growth, the stock could be a good buy in the future. For now, it's a hold.
