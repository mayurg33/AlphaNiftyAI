Here's my thought process and recommendation:

1. **Valuation**: The trailing PE ratio is slightly higher than the forward PE ratio, which indicates that the market is expecting some growth in earnings. However, the trailing PE ratio is 24.06, which is not significantly high considering the industry average. So, valuation is not extremely expensive.

2. **Profitability**: ROE is 28.93%, which is decent and indicates that the company is generating good returns on shareholders' equity. Profit margin is 16.38%, which is also respectable. These metrics suggest that the company is profitable.

3. **Growth**: Revenue growth is 3.6%, which is modest. However, earnings growth is -12.7%, which is a concern. This negative growth could be a sign of challenges in the company's operations or the industry.

4. **Leverage**: Debt-to-equity ratio is 8.55, which is relatively low and indicates that the company has a conservative capital structure.

Considering these factors, I would recommend **HOLD** for Infosys Limited. While the company's valuation and profitability are reasonable, the negative earnings growth is a concern. I would want to monitor the company's performance over the next few quarters to see if they can address the earnings growth issue before making a BUY or SELL recommendation.
