Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

* The Profit Margin is extremely low at 0.06329, indicating that it's struggling to generate profits.
* The Revenue Growth is negative, indicating a decline in revenue.
* The Earnings Growth is None, which means there's no growth in earnings.
* The Debt/Equity ratio is high at 61.549, indicating a high level of debt.

While the PE ratios may appear attractive, the underlying fundamentals suggest that the company is facing significant challenges. Therefore, I would recommend a SELL.
