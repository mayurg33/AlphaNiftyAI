As a financial analyst, I would recommend a HOLD rating for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited. Here's my thought process:

1. **Valuation:** The trailing PE ratio of 69.43 and forward PE ratio of 85.86 suggest that the stock is expensive compared to its peers and the industry average. This could indicate that the stock is overvalued.

2. **Profitability:** The ROE of 18.85% and profit margin of 6.63% are decent but not exceptional. This indicates that the company is generating profits, but not excessively so.

3. **Growth:** The revenue growth rate of 13.1% and earnings growth rate of 53.5% are promising, indicating that the company is growing steadily.

4. **Leverage:** The debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89 is quite high, which could be a concern as it may indicate that the company is over-leveraged.

Considering these factors, I would recommend a HOLD rating because:

* The stock appears overvalued, which might suggest a correction in the future.
* The company's profitability and growth prospects are decent, but not exceptional.
* The high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, but not necessarily a deal-breaker.

Overall, I would recommend holding the stock for now, but keeping a close eye on its future performance and any changes in the company's financials or industry trends.
