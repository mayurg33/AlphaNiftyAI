Here's my chain of thought to arrive at a recommendation:

1. **Valuation**: The trailing PE of 9.31 and forward PE of 9.51 are both relatively low, suggesting that the stock might be undervalued. This is a positive sign.
2. **Profitability**: The profit margin of 6.71% is decent, and the ROE of 13.92% indicates that the company is generating a reasonable return on its equity. This suggests that the company has a good ability to generate profits from its operations.
3. **Growth**: The revenue growth rate of 15.9% and earnings growth rate of 67.2% are both strong, indicating that the company is growing rapidly. This is a positive sign for future prospects.
4. **Debt**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 53.06 is relatively high, which could be a concern. However, given the company's profitability and growth, it's possible that they can manage their debt obligations effectively.

Based on these factors, I would recommend **BUY**. The low valuation, decent profitability, and strong growth prospects outweigh the concern about the high debt-to-equity ratio. Additionally, the company's growth rates suggest that it may be able to reduce its debt burden over time.
