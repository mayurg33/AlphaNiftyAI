Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

* The company is in the Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing industry, which is a cyclical industry. The profitability of the company is heavily dependent on the crude oil prices and government regulations.
* The low Trailing PE and Forward PE ratios may indicate that the stock, but it may also indicate that the market is pricing in lower growth prospects for the company.
* The ROE is low at 16.99%, which indicates that the company is not utilizing its equity efficiently.
* The Revenue Growth and Earnings Growth are both negative, indicating a declining trend in the company's top-line and bottom-line.
* The high Debt/Equity ratio of 75.077 indicates that the company is highly leveraged, which increases the risk of default.

Overall, considering the industry, valuations, and financial performance, I would recommend a SELL.
