Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD for Infosys Limited. Here's why:

* The trailing PE and forward PE are slightly higher than the industry average, indicating that the stock is relatively expensive.
* The ROE and profit margin are decent, indicating that the company is generating reasonable profits from its operations.
* However, the revenue growth and earnings growth are negative, indicating that the company is facing some challenges in growing its top and bottom lines.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is moderate, indicating that the company has a manageable level of debt.

Overall, while the company has some positive factors, the lack of growth in revenue and earnings are concerns. Therefore, I would recommend a HOLD until the company can demonstrate a turnaround in its growth trajectory.
