Based on the provided data, I would recommend a SELL for the stock of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise. Here's why:

1. **Expensive valuation**: The trailing PE is high at 68.81753, and the forward PE is even higher at 85.085785, indicating that the stock is overvalued.
2. **Low ROE**: The return on equity (ROE) is low at 0.18845, suggesting that the company is not generating sufficient profits from shareholders' equity.
3. **High debt-to-equity ratio**: The debt-to-equity ratio is alarmingly high at 90.886, indicating that the company is heavily leveraged, which can be a significant risk factor.
4. **Only moderate growth**: While the revenue growth and earnings growth are positive, they are not exceptional, considering the high valuation and high debt levels.

Overall, considering these factors, I would recommend a SELL to avoid potential losses.
