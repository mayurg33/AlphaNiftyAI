Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL.

The primary concern is the extremely high Trailing PE of 48.22 and Forward PE of 114.90, indicating that the stock is overpriced relative to its earnings. Additionally, the ROE of 5.23% is low, suggesting that the company is not efficiently generating profits from its shareholders' equity. The Debt/Equity ratio of 118.07 is also alarming, indicating high leverage and potential risk of default. While the Revenue Growth and Earnings Growth are positive, they do not justify the current valuation. Overall, the stock appears overvalued and carries significant risk, leading me to recommend a SELL.
