Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

1. **Overvalued**: The trailing PE of 91.36412 and forward PE of 60.920258 indicate that the stock is overvalued compared to its earnings.
2. **Debt/Equity ratio is high**: 178.742 is significantly higher than the industry average, indicating that the company may struggle to meet its debt obligations.
3. **Low ROE**: The ROE of 0.31755 is lower than the industry average, suggesting that the company is not generating enough returns on shareholder equity.
4. **Sluggish growth**: Revenue growth of 0.194 and earnings growth of 0.131 indicate that the company's revenue and earnings are not growing at a satisfactory rate.

Overall, the stock appears to be overvalued, with high debt, low ROE, and sluggish growth. These factors suggest that the stock may be due for a correction, making it a SELL recommendation.
