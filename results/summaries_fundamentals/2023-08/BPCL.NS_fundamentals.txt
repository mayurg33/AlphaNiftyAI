Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL for the stock. Here's why:

* The company is in the oil and gas refining and marketing industry, which is subject to significant volatility and regulatory risks.
* The trailing and forward P/E ratios are relatively low, indicating that the stock may be undervalued. However, this could also be a reflection of the company's poor financial performance.
* The ROE is low, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.
* The profit margin is also very low, indicating that the company's business operations are not very profitable.
* The revenue growth and earnings growth are both negative, indicating that the company's financial performance is deteriorating.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is very high, indicating that the company has a significant amount of debt and may be at risk of default.

Overall, based on these factors, I would recommend a SELL for the stock.
