Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

1. **Overvalued**: The trailing PE of 32.59 is already above the industry average, and the forward PE of 49.81 indicates that the stock is expected to become even more expensive.
2. **Poor earnings growth**: The earnings growth rate is -9.6%, indicating that the company's profitability is declining.
3. **Moderate debt**: Although the debt-to-equity ratio is not alarmingly high, it's still a significant portion of the company's capital structure.
4. **Slow revenue growth**: The revenue growth rate of 10.8% is not impressive, especially considering the sector is consumer cyclical, which typically experiences higher growth rates.

Overall, the company's profitability and growth indicators are concerning, and the stock appears overvalued. Therefore, I would recommend a SELL.
