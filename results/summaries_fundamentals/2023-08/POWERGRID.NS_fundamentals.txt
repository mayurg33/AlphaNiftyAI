Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD. Here's why:

* The trailing PE of 17.46 is a bit higher than the industry average, but the forward PE of 13.46 suggests that the stock is expected to correct in the short term.
* The ROE of 17.26% is decent, indicating that the company is generating good returns on its equity.
* The profit margin of 33.89% is healthy and indicates that the company has a good grip on its costs.
* The revenue growth of 2.5% and earnings growth of -0.4% are not very encouraging, but they are not disastrous either.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 145.25 is high, which is a concern, but it's not unprecedented in the utilities sector.

Overall, while there are some positive factors, the high debt-to-equity ratio and lackluster growth prospects make me hesitant to recommend a BUY. On the other hand, the decent ROE, profit margin, and relatively low forward PE suggest that the stock may not be a SELL either. Hence, a HOLD recommendation seems appropriate.
