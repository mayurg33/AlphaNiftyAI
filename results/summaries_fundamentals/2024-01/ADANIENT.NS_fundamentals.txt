Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD.

Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing PE of 40.45 is slightly high, indicating that the stock might be overvalued. However, the forward PE of 38.44 suggests that the market expects the company's earnings to grow, which is supported by the 11.95% earnings growth rate.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 162.60 is concerning, as it indicates that the company is highly leveraged. This increases the risk of default and may impact the company's ability to pay dividends or invest in growth opportunities.
* The profit margin of 0.0725 is relatively low, indicating that the company may not have much room to maneuver in terms of pricing or cost savings.
* The revenue growth rate of -0.076 is a negative, indicating that the company may be struggling to grow its top line.

Overall, while the company's earnings growth rate is promising, the high debt levels, low profit margin, and negative revenue growth rate are concerns that outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, I would recommend a HOLD until the company can improve its debt position and revenue growth.
