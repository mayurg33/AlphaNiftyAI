Based on the provided data, I would recommend SELL for the stock. Here's a brief justification:

* The debt-to-equity ratio is high, indicating high leverage, which can be a concern for investors.
* The earnings growth rate is negative, indicating a decline in profitability of the company.
* The forward PE ratio is significantly higher than the trailing PE ratio, indicating that the market is expecting a significant improvement in earnings, which may not be justified given the negative earnings growth rate.
* The ROE and profit margin are moderate, but not exceptionally high, which may not justify the high valuation multiples.

Overall, the stock appears to be overvalued, and the negative earnings growth rate and high leverage are concerns that outweigh the moderate profitability and growth prospects.
