I would recommend SELL for the stock. Here's why:

* The company is in a declining industry (Thermal Coal), which is a major concern.
* Revenue growth and earnings growth are both negative, indicating a struggling business.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is very high (9.15), which increases the risk of investing in this company.
* The trailing PE is low (6.786959), but the forward PE is significantly higher (15.30869), indicating that the market expects a decline in earnings.
* ROE and profit margin are moderate, but not strong enough to offset the negatives.

Overall, I believe the company's financials and industry trends suggest a sell recommendation.
