Based on the data, I would recommend a HOLD. Here's a brief justification:

* The trailing and forward PE ratios are reasonable, indicating that the stock is not overvalued.
* ROE is decent, indicating that the company is generating good returns on its equity.
* Debt-to-equity ratio is quite high, which is a concern, but it's not uncommon for companies in the credit services industry to have high debt levels.
* Revenue growth is negative, but earnings growth is marginally positive, indicating some resilience in the company's margins.

Overall, while there are some positives, the high debt levels and negative revenue growth warrant a cautious approach. Hence, a HOLD rating, pending further review and monitoring of the company's performance.
