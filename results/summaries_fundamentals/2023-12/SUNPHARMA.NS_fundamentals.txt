Based on the data, I would recommend a SELL. Here's why:

* The trailing PE is 36.22, which is higher than the industry average, indicating that the stock is overvalued.
* The forward PE is 50.49, which is even higher, suggesting that the market expects the company's earnings to grow, but the earnings growth rate is actually negative (-0.188), indicating a mismatch between expectations and reality.
* The ROE is 0.1571, which is relatively low, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient profit from its equity.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is 3.259, which is high, indicating that the company has taken on significant debt and may struggle to meet its debt obligations if the business deteriorates further.

Overall, the stock appears to be overvalued, with high PE ratios and low earnings growth, making it a sell recommendation.
