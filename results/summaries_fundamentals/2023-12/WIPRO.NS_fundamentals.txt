Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY for Wipro Limited. Here's a brief justification:

* The forward PE ratio is significantly lower than the trailing PE, suggesting that the market expects the company's earnings to grow in the future.
* The ROE and Profit Margin are decent, indicating that the company is generating decent returns on its equity and has a reasonable profit margin.
* The Revenue Growth and Earnings Growth are positive, although slow, indicating that the company is experiencing some growth in both revenue and profitability.
* The Debt/Equity ratio is relatively low, indicating that the company is not over-leveraged and has a manageable level of debt.

Overall, considering the valuation, profitability, growth prospects, and financial health, I believe Wipro Limited is a good buy at current prices.
