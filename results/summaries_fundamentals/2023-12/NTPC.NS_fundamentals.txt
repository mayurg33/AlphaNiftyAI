Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY. Here's why:

* The trailing PE is 16.37, which is relatively high, but the forward PE is 13.83, indicating that the stock is expected to get cheaper in the future.
* The ROE of 13.45% is decent, and the profit margin of 12.45% is respectable for a utility company.
* The revenue growth rate of 4.6% and earnings growth rate of 23.4% is impressive, indicating that the company is able to increase its earnings at a faster rate than its revenue.
* The debt-to-equity ratio of 130.86 is high, but not alarmingly so. The company appears to have a decent balance sheet.

Overall, the stock appears to be a good value play, given its relatively low forward PE and decent growth prospects.
