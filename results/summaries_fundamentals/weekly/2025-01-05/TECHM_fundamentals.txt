Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue growth and earnings growth suggest a positive trajectory. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, which is relatively in line with industry averages. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its high debt levels to improve its overall financial position.
