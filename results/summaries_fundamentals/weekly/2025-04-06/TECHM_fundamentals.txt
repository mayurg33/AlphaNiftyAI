Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high earnings growth rate of 76.4%, suggesting a promising future. However, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is positive, but debt management should be monitored closely.
