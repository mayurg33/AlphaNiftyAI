Tata Consultancy Services Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (38.34%) and return on equity (52.16%). However, its revenue growth (5.3%) and earnings growth (-1.7%) are relatively slow. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 25.29 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.92. A weakness is its high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.81, which may indicate a higher level of financial leverage. Overall, the company's profitability and growth metrics suggest a stable but not exceptional performance.
