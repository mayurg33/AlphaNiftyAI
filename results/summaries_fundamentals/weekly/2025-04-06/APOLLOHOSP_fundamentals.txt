Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and EBITDA margins (13.87%), are also respectable. However, the company's valuation appears to be stretched, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89 is a concern, indicating a high level of leverage. Overall, while the company's growth prospects are promising, investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt position.
