Based on the provided metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation. However, its weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, which may be a concern for investors. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is also relatively high, which may impact its financial flexibility. Overall, the company's valuation seems attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
