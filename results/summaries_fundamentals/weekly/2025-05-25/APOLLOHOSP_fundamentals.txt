Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in earnings growth (53.5%) and decent revenue growth (13.1%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and profit margins (6.63%), indicate a stable and profitable business. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may impact the company's ability to meet its long-term obligations.
