Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile evident from its high gross margins and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 27.38 and forward P/E of 22.66, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81 is a concern, suggesting a high level of indebtedness. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.81 and a strong book value of 690.16. Overall, while the company's growth metrics are moderate, its profitability and valuation are strengths, but debt management is an area of concern.
