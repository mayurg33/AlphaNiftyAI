ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, suggesting a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is a weakness, indicating a moderate level of leverage. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is robust, with a strong growth trajectory and reasonable valuation.
