ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, reflected in its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth is relatively slow at 4.7%, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is a minor concern. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is strong, but it may face challenges in accelerating revenue growth.
