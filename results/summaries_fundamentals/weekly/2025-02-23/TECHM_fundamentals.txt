Based on the metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be financially healthy with strengths in profitability and growth. The company's ROE, EBITDA margins, and profit margins indicate a strong ability to generate earnings. Additionally, the revenue and earnings growth rates suggest a positive trend. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a weakness that needs to be monitored. The company's valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, but the trailing P/E ratio of 34.99 indicates a possible overvaluation. Overall, the company's financial health is strong, but debt management and valuation need to be closely watched.
