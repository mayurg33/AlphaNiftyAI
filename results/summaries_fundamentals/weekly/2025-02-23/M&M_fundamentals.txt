Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong track record of profitability, as evident from its high ROE and profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 27.38 and a forward P/E ratio of 22.66, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81 is a concern, suggesting a high level of debt. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.81 and a strong book value of 690.16. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to work on reducing its debt levels to improve its overall financial position.
