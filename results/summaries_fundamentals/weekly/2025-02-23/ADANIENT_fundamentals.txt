Adani Enterprises Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's strengths include a high earnings growth rate of 11.957% and decent profit margins of 7.25%. However, its revenue growth is negative, and the debt-to-equity ratio is alarmingly high at 162.597, indicating a significant debt burden. The company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 41.373844 and forward P/E of 39.220478. Overall, while the company has some positive aspects, its high debt levels and rich valuation are causes for concern.
