Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong growth trajectory, as evident from its revenue and earnings growth rates. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are also respectable. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 69.43 and a forward P/E ratio of 85.86. A major concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may impact the company's financial flexibility. Overall, the company's strengths lie in its growth prospects, but its valuation and debt position are areas of concern.
