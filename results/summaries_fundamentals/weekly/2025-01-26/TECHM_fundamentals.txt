Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue and earnings growth rates suggest a stable growth trajectory. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, indicating a high level of leverage. The valuation appears reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, which is not excessively high. Overall, Tech Mahindra's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its high debt levels to improve its overall financial position.
