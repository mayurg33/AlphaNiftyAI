Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05% suggest undervaluation and attractiveness to income investors. However, the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are relatively low. The company's growth metrics are also concerning, with negative revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15% raises concerns about the company's debt position. Overall, the company's valuation appears attractive, but its profitability and debt position are areas of concern.
