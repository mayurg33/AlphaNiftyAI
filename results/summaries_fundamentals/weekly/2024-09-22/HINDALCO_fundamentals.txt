Hindalco Industries Limited appears to be in a stable financial position, with a low trailing P/E ratio of 9.31 and a decent ROE of 13.92%. The company's EBITDA margins and gross margins are also respectable, indicating a strong operational performance. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 53.06 is a concern, suggesting that the company may be over-leveraged. On the positive side, the company has demonstrated strong earnings growth of 67.2% and a decent dividend yield of 0.53%. Overall, the company's valuation appears reasonable, but its high debt levels warrant caution.
