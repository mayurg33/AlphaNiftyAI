Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05% suggest undervaluation and attractiveness to income investors. Strengths include high gross margins of 67.9% and a decent ROE of 38.47%. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating challenges in the thermal coal industry. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a concern, but its high profit margins and EBITDA margins provide some comfort. Overall, the company's valuation appears attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position warrant caution.
