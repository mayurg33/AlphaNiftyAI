Tata Consumer Products Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in revenue growth (17.3%) and earnings growth (53.1%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (6.63%) and profit margins (7.26%), are also respectable. However, the valuation appears to be rich, with a trailing P/E of 84.62 and forward P/E of 74.14. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 11.19 is a weakness, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, the company's growth prospects and profitability are strong, but investors may want to exercise caution due to the high valuation and debt position.
