Wipro Limited's financial health appears stable, with strengths in profitability metrics such as ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins. The company's earnings growth rate of 25.1% is also a positive sign. However, the revenue growth rate of 1.3% is a weakness, indicating slow top-line expansion. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48, suggesting potential for upside. The debt-to-equity ratio of 23.12 is manageable, but could be improved. Overall, Wipro's financial health is stable, with room for improvement in revenue growth and debt management.
