ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and a forward P/E of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. A dividend yield of 3.79% also suggests a regular income stream for investors. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 4.7% is relatively low, which could be a concern. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 indicates a moderate level of debt, which may require monitoring. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is strong, but it needs to focus on improving its revenue growth.
