The overall financial health of Titan Company Limited appears to be mixed. The company's high trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest that it may be overvalued. However, its strong ROE and gross margins indicate profitability and efficiency. A weakness is the low profit margin, which may be a concern. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is also high, which could be a risk. On the other hand, the company has a decent revenue and earnings growth, and a reasonable dividend yield.
