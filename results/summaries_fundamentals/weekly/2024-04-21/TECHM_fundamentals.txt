Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 26.46, indicating potential for future growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a concern, suggesting that the company may be over-leveraged. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 2.62% and a strong book value of 308.86. Overall, while the company's growth metrics are moderate, its profitability and valuation metrics are strengths, but debt management needs attention.
