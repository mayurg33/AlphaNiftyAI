Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include high gross margins and EBITDA margins, indicating efficient operations and profitability. The company's ROE and profit margins are also respectable, suggesting effective use of shareholder equity. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, indicating high leverage. The valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.36 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.84, suggesting potential for future growth.
