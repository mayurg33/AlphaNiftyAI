Adani Enterprises Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high earnings growth rate of 11.957 and decent profit margins of 0.072519995. However, the company's valuation seems stretched with a trailing P/E of 40.418312 and forward P/E of 38.415905. A major weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 162.597, indicating a significant debt burden. The company's revenue growth is also negative, which is a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is fragile, and investors should exercise caution.
