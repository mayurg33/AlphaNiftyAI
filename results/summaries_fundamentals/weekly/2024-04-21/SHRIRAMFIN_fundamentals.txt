Shriram Finance Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong profitability profile, reflected in its high gross margins (96.74%) and profit margins (54.33%). The company's ROE of 17.78% indicates efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with revenue growth being negative and earnings growth being modest. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 315.41 is high, indicating a leveraged balance sheet. Overall, the company's valuation appears reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 13.19 and forward P/E of 10.71.
