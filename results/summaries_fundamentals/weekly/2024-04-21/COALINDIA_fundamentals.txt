Based on the metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.79 and high dividend yield of 8.08% suggest that it may be undervalued. Additionally, its high gross margins of 67.9% and profit margins of 27.9% indicate a strong profitability position. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth are negative, indicating a decline in business performance. Furthermore, the high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 raises concerns about its debt position. Overall, the company's valuation appears attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
