UltraTech Cement Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in its high gross margins (57.71%) and moderate EBITDA margins (16.53%). However, its profitability metrics, such as ROE (9.00%) and profit margins (7.95%), are relatively low. The company's valuation is rich, with a trailing P/E of 56.49 and forward P/E of 84.49, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The debt-to-equity ratio of 32.62 is manageable, but the dividend yield of 0.61% is relatively low. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but investors may want to exercise caution due to the high valuation.
