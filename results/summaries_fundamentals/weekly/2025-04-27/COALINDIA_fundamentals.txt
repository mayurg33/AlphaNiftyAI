Based on the metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths lie in its high dividend yield of 8.05% and low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation. However, its weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15, which may pose a risk to its financial stability. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are moderate. Overall, the company's valuation seems attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are concerns that need to be monitored.
