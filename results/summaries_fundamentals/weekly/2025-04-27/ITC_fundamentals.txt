ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's growth metrics are also promising, with a decent revenue growth rate and an impressive earnings growth rate. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 indicates a manageable debt position. Overall, ITC Limited's strengths lie in its profitability and growth, while its valuation and debt position are areas of caution.
