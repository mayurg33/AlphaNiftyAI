Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins (40.68%) and EBITDA margins (20.28%) indicate a profitable business model. The company's ROE (16.89%) and profit margins (8.01%) also suggest efficient use of shareholders' equity. However, the debt-to-equity ratio (144.81) is a concern, indicating high leverage. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E of 22.66, but the high trailing P/E of 27.38 may indicate some overvaluation. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability and growth are somewhat offset by its high debt levels.
