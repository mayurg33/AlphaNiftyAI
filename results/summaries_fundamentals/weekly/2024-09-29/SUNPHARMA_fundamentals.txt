Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and EBITDA margin of 28.69%. The company's return on equity (ROE) of 15.71% indicates efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, and the debt-to-equity ratio of 3.259 is a concern. The stock appears to be overvalued with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and forward P/E of 50.85. Overall, the company's financial health is mixed, with strengths in profitability and weaknesses in growth and debt management.
