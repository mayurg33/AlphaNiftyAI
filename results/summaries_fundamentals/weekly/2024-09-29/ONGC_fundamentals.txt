Based on the metrics, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong valuation. The company's low trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest it is undervalued. Strengths include high gross margins and a decent dividend yield of 6.96%. However, weaknesses include negative earnings growth and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 50.187, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company's profitability metrics are decent, but its growth metrics are a concern.
