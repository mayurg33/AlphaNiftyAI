Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include high gross margins (79.56%) and a decent profit margin (20.79%), indicating efficient operations. However, the company's weaknesses lie in its slow revenue growth (8.1%) and declining earnings (-18.8%). The valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and a forward P/E of 50.85, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. Additionally, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a concern, indicating a high level of leverage.
