ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its profitability metrics, such as high ROE, EBITDA margins, and profit margins. The company's growth metrics also indicate a strong performance, with significant earnings growth and a decent revenue growth. However, the valuation metrics suggest that the stock may be slightly overvalued, with a trailing P/E ratio above 26. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, but not extremely low. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is robust, but investors should be cautious of the valuation and debt position.
