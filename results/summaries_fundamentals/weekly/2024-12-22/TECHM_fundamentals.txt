Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 4% is a concern, suggesting a need for improvement in this area. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a weakness, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, Tech Mahindra's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its revenue growth and debt position to sustain long-term success.
