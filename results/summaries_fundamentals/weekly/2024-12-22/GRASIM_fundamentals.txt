Grasim Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins (57.88%) and decent EBITDA margins (19.03%) indicate a profitable business model. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a high trailing P/E ratio (50.05) and an even higher forward P/E ratio (119.25). A significant concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio (118.07), which may impact its financial flexibility. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield (0.37%) and a strong book value (1448.40).
