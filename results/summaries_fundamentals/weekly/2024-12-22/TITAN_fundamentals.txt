Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the luxury goods industry. Its high profit margins (5.52%) and decent EBITDA margins (9.42%) indicate efficient operations. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are moderate, but its high ROE (31.75%) suggests effective use of shareholders' capital. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 94.00 and forward P/E of 62.76, indicating that investors have high expectations. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may impact its ability to weather economic downturns.
