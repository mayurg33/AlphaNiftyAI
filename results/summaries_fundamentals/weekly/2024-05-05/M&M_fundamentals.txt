Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include a high gross margin of 40.68% and a decent ROE of 16.89%, indicating efficient operations and profitability. However, the company's valuation seems to be slightly stretched, with a trailing P/E of 27.38 and forward P/E of 22.66. A weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's growth metrics, such as revenue and earnings growth, are moderate, and its dividend yield is relatively low at 0.81%.
