Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strong growth prospects. Its high revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%) indicate a promising future. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and gross margins (35.4%), are also impressive. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86. A concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may impact its financial flexibility.
