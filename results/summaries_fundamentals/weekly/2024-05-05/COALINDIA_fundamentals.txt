Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and decent gross margins of 67.9%. However, the company's profitability is a concern, with low ROE of 3.85% and declining revenue and earnings growth. The valuation is relatively cheap, with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but the forward P/E of 15.44 suggests potential overvaluation. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a weakness, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is mediocre, with areas for improvement in profitability and debt management.
