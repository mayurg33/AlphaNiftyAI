Hindustan Unilever Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and return on equity (ROE). The company's valuation, however, seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 49.99 and forward P/E ratio of 43.91. A major weakness is the decline in earnings growth, which could be a concern for investors. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is also relatively high at 3.32. On the positive side, the company offers a decent dividend yield of 2.11 and has a strong book value of 210.26.
