Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and EBITDA margins (13.87%), indicate a strong ability to generate profits. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86. A major weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability.
