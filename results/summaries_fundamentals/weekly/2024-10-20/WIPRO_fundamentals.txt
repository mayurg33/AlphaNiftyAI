Wipro Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile reflected in its high gross margins and decent profit margins. The company's ROE and earnings growth are also notable strengths. However, its revenue growth is sluggish, which could be a concern. The stock appears to be reasonably valued, with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48, which is lower than its trailing P/E ratio. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is moderate, indicating a manageable debt position. Overall, Wipro's financial health is stable, but it needs to improve its revenue growth to sustain its profitability.
