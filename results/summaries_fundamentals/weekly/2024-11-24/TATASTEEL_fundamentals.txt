Tata Steel Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high gross margin and a decent dividend yield. However, weaknesses include a low ROE, profit margin, and revenue growth. The company's valuation seems rich with a trailing P/E of 56.49, but the forward P/E of 8.90 suggests potential for improvement. The debt-to-equity ratio of 103.78 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is fragile, and investors should exercise caution.
