Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile reflected in its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 0.04 is a concern, suggesting a slow pace of expansion. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is also a weakness, indicating a high level of leverage. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability and valuation are offset by weaknesses in growth and debt position.
