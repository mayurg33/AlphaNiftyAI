Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include decent revenue and earnings growth, as well as a relatively high ROE and EBITDA margins. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 27.38. A weakness is its high debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81, which may be a concern. Overall, the company's profitability metrics are satisfactory, but investors should be cautious of its valuation and debt position.
