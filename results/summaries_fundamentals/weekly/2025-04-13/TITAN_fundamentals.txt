Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include high gross margins and a decent profit margin, indicating efficient operations. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E ratio of 94, suggesting that it may be overpriced. A weakness is its high debt-to-equity ratio, which may pose a risk to its financial stability. Despite this, the company's revenue and earnings growth are positive, and it offers a moderate dividend yield. Overall, Titan Company Limited's financial health is good, but investors should be cautious of its high valuation and debt position.
