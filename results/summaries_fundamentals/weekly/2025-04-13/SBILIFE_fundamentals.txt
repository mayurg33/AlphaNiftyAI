Its strengths include a high return on equity (ROE) of 15.13% and decent profit margins of 2.06%. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 76.76 and forward P/E ratio of 70.32. The company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative revenue growth and minimal earnings growth. On the positive side, the company has no debt, indicating a strong debt position.
