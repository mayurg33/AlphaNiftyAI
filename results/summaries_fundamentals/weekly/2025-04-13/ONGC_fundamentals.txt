Based on the provided metrics, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong valuation. The company's low trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest it is undervalued, and its high dividend yield of 6.96% is attractive. The company's gross margins and EBITDA margins are also strong, indicating efficient operations. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth are sluggish, and its debt-to-equity ratio is high at 50.187, which could be a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its growth and debt issues.
