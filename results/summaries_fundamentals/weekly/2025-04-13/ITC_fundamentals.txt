ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. A notable strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, suggesting a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 4.7% is relatively modest, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 indicates a moderate level of leverage. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is robust, but it may face challenges in accelerating revenue growth.
