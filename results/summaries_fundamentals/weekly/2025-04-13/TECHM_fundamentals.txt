Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 4% is a concern, indicating a slow pace of expansion. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a weakness, suggesting a high level of leverage. Overall, Tech Mahindra's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its slow revenue growth and high debt levels to sustain its profitability.
