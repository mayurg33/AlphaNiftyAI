ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating a potential upside. A key strength is its consistent earnings growth, with a 2.84% earnings growth rate. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 0.047 is a concern. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is manageable, and the dividend yield of 3.79% is attractive. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is strong, with some room for improvement in revenue growth.
