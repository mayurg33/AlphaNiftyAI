Hindustan Unilever Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in its high gross margins (51.17%) and decent profit margins (16.87%). The company's ROE of 21.12% indicates efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with revenue growth of only 3% and earnings growth of -3.8%. The company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 49.99 and forward P/E of 43.91. The debt-to-equity ratio of 3.32 is a weakness, indicating a relatively high level of debt.
