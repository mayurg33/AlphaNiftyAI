UltraTech Cement Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in its high gross margins (57.71%) and decent EBITDA margins (16.53%). However, its profitability metrics, such as ROE (9.00%) and profit margins (7.95%), are relatively low. The company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 56.50 and forward P/E of 84.49, indicating that the market has high expectations. The debt-to-equity ratio of 32.62 is manageable, but the dividend yield of 0.61% is relatively low. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but investors should be cautious of its high valuation.
