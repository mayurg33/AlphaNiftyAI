Grasim Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins and EBITDA margins indicate a profitable business model. However, the company's valuation seems stretched with a high trailing P/E ratio of 50.05 and forward P/E ratio of 119.25. A major concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 118.07, which may pose a risk to its financial health. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.37 and a strong book value of 1448.39.
