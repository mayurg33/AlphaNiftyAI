Based on the provided metrics, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong valuation. The company's low trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest it is undervalued, with a high dividend yield of 6.96%. Its strong gross margins and EBITDA margins indicate a profitable business. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth are sluggish, and its debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high at 50.187. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its growth concerns and high debt levels.
