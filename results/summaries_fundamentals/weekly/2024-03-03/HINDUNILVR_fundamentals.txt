Hindustan Unilever Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and ROE. The company's valuation, however, seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E of 49.99 and forward P/E of 43.91. A key weakness is the negative earnings growth, which may be a concern for investors. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is also relatively high at 3.322. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 2.11 and a strong book value of 210.258.
