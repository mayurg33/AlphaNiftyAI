Based on the provided metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation. However, its weaknesses lie in its declining revenue and earnings growth, with negative growth rates of -0.129 and -0.292, respectively. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is also a concern. Overall, while the company's valuation appears attractive, its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
