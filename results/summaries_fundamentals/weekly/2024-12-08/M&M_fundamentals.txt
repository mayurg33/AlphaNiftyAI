Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include high gross margins and a decent return on equity (ROE). However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 27.38, which may indicate that the stock is overvalued. The debt-to-equity ratio is also a concern, standing at 144.81, which may impact the company's ability to meet its long-term obligations. Overall, the company's growth metrics are moderate, with revenue and earnings growth rates of 0.223 and 0.181, respectively.
