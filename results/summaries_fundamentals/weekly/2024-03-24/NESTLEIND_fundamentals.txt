Nestl√© India Limited's financial health appears strong, with high gross margins (55.89%) and decent profit margins (15.92%). The company's ROE (8.73%) and EBITDA margins (23.00%) also indicate efficient operations. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 71.13 and forward P/E of 58.78, suggesting potential overvaluation. A weakness is the negative earnings growth (-6.5%) and modest revenue growth (4.5%). The debt-to-equity ratio (29.11%) is manageable, but the company's high valuation and slow growth may warrant caution.
