Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins, indicate a robust operating performance. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 144.812 is a concern, suggesting high leverage. The valuation metrics, with a trailing P/E of 27.38 and forward P/E of 22.66, indicate that the stock may be slightly overvalued. Overall, the company's growth metrics, including revenue and earnings growth, are moderate, but the dividend yield of 0.81% is a positive aspect.
