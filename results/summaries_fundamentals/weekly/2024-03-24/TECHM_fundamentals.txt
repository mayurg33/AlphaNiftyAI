Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some areas of strength and weakness. The company's high ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue growth and earnings growth suggest a positive trend. However, the trailing P/E ratio is relatively high, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is also a concern, suggesting that it may be over-leveraged. Overall, Tech Mahindra's financial health is stable, but investors should be cautious of its valuation and debt position.
