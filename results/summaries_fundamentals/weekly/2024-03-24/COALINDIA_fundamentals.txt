Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05% suggest undervaluation and attractive income potential. However, the negative revenue and earnings growth rates indicate challenges in its core business. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are moderate. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15, which may impact its financial flexibility. Overall, the company's valuation is attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
