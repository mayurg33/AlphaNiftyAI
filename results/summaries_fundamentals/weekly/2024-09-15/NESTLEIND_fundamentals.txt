Nestl√© India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the packaged foods industry. Its high gross margins (55.89%) and ROE (8.73%) indicate efficient operations and ability to generate profits. However, the company's high trailing P/E (71.13) and forward P/E (58.78) suggest that it may be overvalued. A weakness is the negative earnings growth (-6.5%) and low dividend yield (1.7%). The company's debt-to-equity ratio (29.11) is manageable, indicating a relatively stable debt position.
