ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE, EBITDA margins, and profit margins. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are moderate, but its dividend yield is attractive. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27. The debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, indicating a stable debt position. Overall, ITC Limited's strengths lie in its profitability and dividend yield, while its weaknesses include moderate growth rates and high valuation.
