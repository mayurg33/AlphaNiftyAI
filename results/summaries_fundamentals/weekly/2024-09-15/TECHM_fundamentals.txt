Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 0.04 is a concern, suggesting sluggish top-line expansion. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is relatively high, which could be a weakness. Overall, the company's strong profitability and reasonable valuation are offset by its slow revenue growth and high debt levels.
