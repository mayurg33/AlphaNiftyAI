Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05% suggest undervaluation and attractive income potential. Strengths include decent ROE and EBITDA margins, indicating some profitability. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, which may be a concern. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is also relatively high, which could impact its financial flexibility. Overall, the company's valuation appears attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position warrant caution.
