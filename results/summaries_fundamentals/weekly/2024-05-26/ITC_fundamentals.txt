ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high earnings growth rate of 2.84%, indicating a strong track record of profitability. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 0.047 is a weakness, suggesting slow top-line expansion. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 indicates a manageable debt position, and the dividend yield of 3.79% is attractive for income investors.
