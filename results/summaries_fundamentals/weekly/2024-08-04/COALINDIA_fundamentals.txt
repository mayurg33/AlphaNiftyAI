Based on the provided metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation. However, the company's weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, suggesting a decline in business performance.
