Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high profit margins (5.52%) and EBITDA margins (9.42%) indicate efficient operations. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are also promising, at 19.4% and 13.1%, respectively. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 94.00 and forward P/E of 62.76, indicating that investors may be pricing in high expectations. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability if not managed properly.
