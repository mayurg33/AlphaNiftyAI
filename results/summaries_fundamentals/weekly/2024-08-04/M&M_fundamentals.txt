Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins and EBITDA margins indicate a profitable business model. The company's ROE and profit margins are also respectable, suggesting efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the trailing P/E ratio is relatively high, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability if not managed properly. Overall, the company's growth metrics are moderate, with revenue and earnings growth rates around 20%.
