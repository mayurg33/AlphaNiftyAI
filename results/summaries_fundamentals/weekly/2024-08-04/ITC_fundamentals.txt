ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. A strength of the company is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 4.7% is a weakness, indicating a need for improvement in this area. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 suggests a moderate level of debt, which could be a concern if not managed effectively.
