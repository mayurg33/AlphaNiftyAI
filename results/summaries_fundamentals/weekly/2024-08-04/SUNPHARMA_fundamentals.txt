Based on the provided metrics, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include high gross margins (79.56%) and a decent profit margin (20.79%). However, its weaknesses lie in its low return on equity (15.71%) and declining earnings growth (-18.8%). The company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and a forward P/E of 50.85. Additionally, its debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 indicates a high level of debt, which could be a concern.
