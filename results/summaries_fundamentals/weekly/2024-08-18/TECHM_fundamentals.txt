Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins. The company's earnings growth rate of 76.4% is a significant strength, indicating a promising future outlook. However, the revenue growth rate of 4% is a weakness, suggesting a need for improvement in this area. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, but its debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a concern, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, the company's financial health is positive, but debt management and revenue growth are areas that require attention.
