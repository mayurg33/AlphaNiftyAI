Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05 suggest undervaluation and attractiveness for income investors. However, the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are relatively low. The negative revenue and earnings growth rates are a concern, indicating declining performance. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is also a weakness, suggesting high leverage. Overall, the company's valuation is attractive, but its profitability and growth metrics are areas of concern.
