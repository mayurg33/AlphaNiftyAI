Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include a high gross margin and decent revenue growth. However, the company's valuation seems stretched with a trailing P/E ratio of 91.56 and a forward P/E ratio of 61.05, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are moderate, suggesting room for improvement.
