Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and EBITDA margin of 28.69%. The company's ROE of 15.71% indicates efficient use of shareholder equity. However, the company's earnings growth is a concern, with a decline of 18.8%. The valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 36.14 and forward P/E of 50.38. The debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a weakness, indicating high leverage.
