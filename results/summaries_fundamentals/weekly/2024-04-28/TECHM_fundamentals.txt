Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 26.46, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 4% is relatively low, which could be a concern. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a weakness, indicating high leverage. Overall, Tech Mahindra's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its revenue growth and debt position to sustain long-term growth.
