ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.31 and a forward P/E of 21.91, indicating a potential for future growth. A notable strength is its high dividend yield of 3.76%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth is sluggish, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is a concern. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is robust, but it needs to address its slow revenue growth and moderate debt levels.
