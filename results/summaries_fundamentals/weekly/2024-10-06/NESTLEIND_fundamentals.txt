Nestl√© India Limited exhibits a mixed financial health profile. Strengths include high gross margins (55.89%) and a decent dividend yield (1.7%). However, the company's valuation appears rich, with a trailing P/E of 71.13 and forward P/E of 58.78. Weaknesses include low revenue growth (4.5%) and negative earnings growth (-6.5%). The debt-to-equity ratio of 29.11 is manageable, but not ideal. Overall, the company's high valuation and slow growth metrics may be a concern for investors.
