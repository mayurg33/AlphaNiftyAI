ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE, EBITDA margins, and profit margins. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are moderate, but its dividend yield is attractive. However, the stock seems to be trading at a premium valuation, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, indicating a relatively stable debt position. Overall, ITC Limited's strengths lie in its profitability and dividend yield, while its weaknesses include a high valuation and moderate growth rates.
