Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation, and a high dividend yield of 8.05%. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are also relatively low. Overall, the company's valuation seems attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are concerns.
