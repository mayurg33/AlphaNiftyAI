Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high ROE and gross margins indicate profitability and efficiency in its luxury goods business. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E ratio of 94 and a forward P/E ratio of 63, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 179, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. On the other hand, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are moderate, and the dividend yield is relatively attractive at 0.31%.
