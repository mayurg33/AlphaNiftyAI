Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include a high gross margin and decent revenue growth. However, the company's valuation is expensive, with a trailing P/E ratio of 94.00 and a forward P/E ratio of 62.76, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, while the company has some positive fundamentals, its high valuation and debt levels warrant caution.
