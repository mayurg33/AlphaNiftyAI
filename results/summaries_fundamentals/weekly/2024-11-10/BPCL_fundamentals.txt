Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited's financial health appears to be mixed. The company's low trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest undervaluation, and its high dividend yield of 4.94% is a strength. However, the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE, EBITDA margins, and profit margins, are relatively low. The company's revenue and earnings growth are also negative, indicating weakness. Additionally, the high debt-to-equity ratio of 75.077 is a concern, suggesting that the company may be over-leveraged.
