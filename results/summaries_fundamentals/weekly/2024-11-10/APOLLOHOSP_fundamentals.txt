Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in earnings growth (53.5%) and decent revenue growth (13.1%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and gross margins (35.4%), are also respectable. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. A significant weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability.
