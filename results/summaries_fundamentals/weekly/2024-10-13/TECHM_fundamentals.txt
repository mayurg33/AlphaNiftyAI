Based on the metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in profitability and growth. The company's ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while revenue and earnings growth rates suggest a positive outlook. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 34.99 and forward P/E ratio of 25.93. The debt-to-equity ratio of 7.287 is a concern, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt position.
