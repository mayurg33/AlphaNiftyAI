Hindalco Industries Limited appears to be in a relatively stable financial position. The company's low trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest it may be undervalued. Strengths include a high ROE and EBITDA margins, indicating efficient operations. However, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is high, which could be a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is decent, with room for improvement in its debt position.
