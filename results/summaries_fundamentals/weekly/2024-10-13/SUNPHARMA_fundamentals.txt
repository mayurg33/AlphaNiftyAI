Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins (79.56%) and EBITDA margins (28.69%) indicate a profitable business model. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, with earnings growth being negative. The valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and forward P/E of 50.85. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a concern, but its dividend yield of 0.66% provides some comfort. Overall, the company's financial health is decent, but it needs to improve its growth prospects and debt position.
