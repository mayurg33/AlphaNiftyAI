Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited appears to be financially healthy, with strengths in profitability metrics such as high EBITDA margins (59.37%) and gross margins (66.35%). The company also exhibits decent growth prospects, with revenue growth of 23.1% and earnings growth of 47.8%. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 27.06 and forward P/E of 41.58, indicating potential overvaluation. A significant concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 79.19, which may impact the company's financial flexibility.
