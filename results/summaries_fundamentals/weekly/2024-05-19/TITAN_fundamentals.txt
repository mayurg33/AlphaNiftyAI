Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high ROE and gross margins indicate efficient operations and profitability. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 94 and forward P/E of 63, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A major concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 179, which may impact its financial flexibility. On the positive side, the company has a decent revenue growth rate and pays a dividend yield of 0.31%.
