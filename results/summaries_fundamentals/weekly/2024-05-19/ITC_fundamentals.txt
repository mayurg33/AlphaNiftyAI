ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and a forward P/E of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. A strength of the company is its ability to generate consistent earnings growth, with a 2.84% earnings growth rate. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 0.047% is a weakness. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 indicates a manageable debt position, and the dividend yield of 3.79% suggests a attractive return for investors.
