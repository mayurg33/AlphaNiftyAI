Bajaj Auto Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include high gross margins (32.99%) and a decent dividend yield (2.53%). However, the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (22.84%) and profit margins (13.96%), are moderate. Weaknesses include negative earnings growth (-9.6%) and a high debt-to-equity ratio (26.25%). The company's valuation appears stretched, with a trailing P/E of 31.99 and a forward P/E of 48.93, indicating that the stock may be overpriced.
