Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in revenue and earnings growth, as well as decent profitability margins. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E ratio of 69.43 and a forward P/E ratio of 85.86, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. A major weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt levels.
