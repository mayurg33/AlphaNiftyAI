ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and a forward P/E of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low at 4.7%. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is manageable at 0.404, and it offers a decent dividend yield of 3.79%. Overall, ITC Limited's strengths lie in its profitability and dividend yield, while its weakness is its slow revenue growth.
