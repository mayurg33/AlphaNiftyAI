Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company. Its strengths include a high ROE of 15.48%, indicating efficient use of shareholders' equity, and a decent dividend yield of 2.68%. The company's profitability metrics, such as EBITDA margins and gross margins, are also respectable. However, the company's revenue growth is sluggish at 4%, and its debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high at 7.29. The valuation appears to be reasonable, with a forward P/E of 25.93, but the trailing P/E is slightly elevated at 34.99. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to work on improving its revenue growth and debt position.
