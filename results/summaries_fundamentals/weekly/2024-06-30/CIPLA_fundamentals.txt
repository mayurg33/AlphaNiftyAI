Cipla Limited's financial health appears stable, with strengths in profitability and growth. The company boasts high gross margins (66.35%) and decent profit margins (19.34%), indicating efficient operations. Its revenue and earnings growth rates are also promising, at 8.9% and 30.1%, respectively. However, the company's valuation seems slightly rich, with a trailing P/E ratio of 23.04 and forward P/E ratio of 23.64. Additionally, its debt-to-equity ratio of 1.404 suggests a moderate level of leverage, which could be a concern.
