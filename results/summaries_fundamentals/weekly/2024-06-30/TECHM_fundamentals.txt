Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and gross margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue growth and earnings growth suggest a promising future. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating a potential upside. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its high debt levels to improve its overall financial position.
