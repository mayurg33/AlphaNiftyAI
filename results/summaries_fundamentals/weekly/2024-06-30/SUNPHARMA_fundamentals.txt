Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and a decent profit margin of 20.79%. The company's return on equity (ROE) of 15.71% indicates efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, with earnings growth being negative. The company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and a forward P/E of 50.85. Additionally, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a concern, indicating high leverage.
