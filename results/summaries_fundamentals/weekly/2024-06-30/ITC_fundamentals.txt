ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile reflected in its high gross margins and profit margins. The company's ROE and EBITDA margins are also respectable, indicating efficient use of capital. However, the company's growth metrics are somewhat muted, with revenue growth being relatively slow. The valuation appears to be reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, but the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is a slight concern. Overall, the company's strong profitability and reasonable valuation are strengths, while its slow revenue growth and moderate debt levels are weaknesses.
