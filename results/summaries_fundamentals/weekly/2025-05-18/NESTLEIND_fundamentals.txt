Nestl√© India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the consumer defensive sector. Its high gross margins (55.89%) and profit margins (15.92%) indicate a strong pricing power and efficient operations. However, the company's high trailing P/E ratio (71.13) and forward P/E ratio (58.78) suggest that it may be overvalued. A weakness is the negative earnings growth (-6.5%) and low revenue growth (4.5%). The company's debt-to-equity ratio (29.11) is manageable, and its dividend yield (1.7%) is attractive.
