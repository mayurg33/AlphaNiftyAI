Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 4% is a concern, indicating slow growth. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a weakness, suggesting high leverage. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability and valuation are offset by weaknesses in growth and debt position.
