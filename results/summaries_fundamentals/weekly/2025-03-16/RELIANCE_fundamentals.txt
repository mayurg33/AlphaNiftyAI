Reliance Industries Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins and EBITDA margins indicate a profitable business model. The company's ROE and profit margins are moderate, suggesting room for improvement. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E ratio of 20.19, indicating potential for growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 36.61 is a concern, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, the company's financial health is strong, but debt management is an area that requires attention.
