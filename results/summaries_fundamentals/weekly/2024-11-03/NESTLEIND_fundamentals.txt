Nestl√© India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the consumer defensive sector. Its high gross margins (55.89%) and EBITDA margins (23.01%) indicate a profitable business model. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, with revenue growth at 4.5% and earnings growth at -6.5%. The company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 71.13 and forward P/E of 58.78. Despite a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 29.11, the company's dividend yield of 1.7% suggests a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders.
