ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, reflected in its high gross margins and profit margins. The company's ROE and EBITDA margins also indicate efficient use of capital. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low, which could be a concern. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, and the dividend yield of 3.79% is attractive. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 suggests a manageable debt position. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is strong, but it needs to improve its revenue growth to sustain long-term profitability.
