ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evidenced by its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.31 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.91, indicating potential for future growth. A strength of the company is its ability to generate consistent earnings growth, with a 2.84% earnings growth rate. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 0.047 is a weakness. Additionally, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 indicates a moderate level of debt, which may be a concern. Overall, ITC Limited appears to be a stable company with a strong profitability profile, but with some areas for improvement.
