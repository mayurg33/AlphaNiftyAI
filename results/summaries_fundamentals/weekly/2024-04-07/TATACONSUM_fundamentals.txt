Tata Consumer Products Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in profitability and growth. The company boasts high gross margins and EBITDA margins, indicating efficient operations. Additionally, its revenue and earnings growth rates are promising, suggesting a strong future outlook. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E ratio of 81.38, which may indicate that the stock is overpriced. The debt-to-equity ratio of 11.19 is a weakness, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, the company's financial health is strong, but investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt position.
