Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include high gross margins and a decent profit margin, indicating efficient operations. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E ratio of 91.56 and a forward P/E ratio of 61.05, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's growth metrics are moderate, with revenue and earnings growth rates of 19.4% and 13.1%, respectively.
