Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong track record of profitability and growth. The company's high ROE and profit margins indicate efficient use of shareholder capital, while its moderate debt-to-equity ratio suggests a manageable debt position. However, the company's valuation appears to be slightly rich, with a trailing P/E ratio of 34.99, which may be a concern for investors. On the other hand, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are respectable, and its dividend yield is attractive. Overall, Tech Mahindra's financial health is strong, but investors should be cautious of its valuation.
