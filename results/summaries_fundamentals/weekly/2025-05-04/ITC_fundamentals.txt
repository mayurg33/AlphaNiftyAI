ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and a forward P/E of 21.87, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth is relatively slow at 4.7%, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is a minor concern. Overall, ITC Limited appears to be a stable and profitable company with a reasonable valuation.
