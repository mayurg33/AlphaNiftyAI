Based on the provided metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths lie in its high dividend yield of 8.05% and decent gross margins of 67.9%. However, its weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating a decline in business performance. The company's valuation seems attractive with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but its forward P/E of 15.44 suggests potential overvaluation. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a concern, indicating high leverage.
