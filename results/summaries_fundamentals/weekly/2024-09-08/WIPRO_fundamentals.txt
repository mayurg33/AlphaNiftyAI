Wipro Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and return on equity (ROE). The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 1.3% is a concern, indicating a need for improvement in this area. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 23.12 is manageable, and its dividend yield of 2.28% is attractive. Overall, Wipro's strengths lie in its profitability and valuation, while its weakness is its slow revenue growth.
