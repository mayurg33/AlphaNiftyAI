Adani Enterprises Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high earnings growth rate of 11.957% and a decent return on equity (ROE) of 15.93%. However, the company's revenue growth is negative, and its debt-to-equity ratio is high at 162.597, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing. The valuation appears rich, with a trailing P/E of 41.37 and a forward P/E of 39.22. Overall, the company's profitability metrics are decent, but its high debt levels and negative revenue growth are concerns.
