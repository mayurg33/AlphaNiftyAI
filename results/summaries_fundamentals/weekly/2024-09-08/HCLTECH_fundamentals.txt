HCL Technologies Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, reflected in its high gross margins and profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.42 and a forward P/E ratio of 24.09, indicating a moderate premium. However, the company's growth metrics are somewhat subdued, with revenue and earnings growth rates of 2% and 1.6%, respectively. A notable strength is the company's high dividend yield of 4.23%, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.02 is a weakness, suggesting a relatively high level of debt.
