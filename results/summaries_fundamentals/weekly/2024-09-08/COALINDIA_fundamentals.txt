Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and decent profitability metrics such as ROE and gross margins. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating a decline in business performance. The company's valuation is relatively low, with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but its forward P/E is higher at 15.44. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio is high at 9.15, which may be a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is stable but with some areas for improvement.
