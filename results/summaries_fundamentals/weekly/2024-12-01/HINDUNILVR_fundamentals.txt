Hindustan Unilever Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and return on equity (ROE). The company's valuation, however, seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 49.99 and a forward P/E ratio of 43.91. A weakness is the slow revenue growth and declining earnings growth. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is also relatively high at 3.322. On the positive side, the company offers a decent dividend yield of 2.11%.
