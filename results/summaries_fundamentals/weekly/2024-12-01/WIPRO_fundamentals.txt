Wipro Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48, indicating potential for future growth. However, the company's revenue growth is sluggish, and its debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which could be a concern. On the positive side, the company has a decent ROE and a stable dividend yield of 2.28%. Overall, Wipro's financial health is stable, but it needs to focus on improving its revenue growth and debt management.
