Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and a decent profit margin of 20.79%. The company's ROE of 15.71% indicates efficient use of shareholder equity. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative earnings growth and a low revenue growth rate. The valuation appears to be stretched, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and a forward P/E of 50.85. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a weakness, indicating a high level of leverage.
