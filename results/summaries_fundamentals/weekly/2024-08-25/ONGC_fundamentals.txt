Based on the provided metrics, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include a high dividend yield of 6.96% and relatively low valuation multiples (trailing P/E of 8.47 and forward P/E of 6.83). However, the company's weaknesses include negative earnings growth (-0.334) and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 50.187. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are also relatively low. Overall, the company's valuation appears attractive, but its debt position and earnings growth are concerns.
