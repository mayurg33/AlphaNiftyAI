Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and decent gross margins of 67.9%. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating a decline in business performance. The company's valuation is relatively low, with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but its debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is stable but faces growth challenges.
