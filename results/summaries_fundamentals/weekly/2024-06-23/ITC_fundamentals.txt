ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its profitability metrics, such as high gross margins and profit margins. The company's ROE and EBITDA margins also indicate efficient use of capital. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low, which could be a concern. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, and its debt-to-equity ratio is manageable at 0.404. Overall, ITC Limited appears to be a stable company with a strong profitability profile, but may need to focus on driving revenue growth.
