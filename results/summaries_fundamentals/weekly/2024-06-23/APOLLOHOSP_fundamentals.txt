Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strong growth prospects. Its high revenue and earnings growth rates (13.1% and 53.5%, respectively) indicate a promising future. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are also respectable. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A significant concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may impact the company's ability to meet its long-term obligations.
