Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and a decent profit margin of 20.79%. The company's ROE of 15.71% indicates efficient use of shareholder equity. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, with a decline in earnings growth. The valuation seems rich with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and forward P/E of 50.85, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a concern, suggesting a high level of debt.
