Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high ROE and gross margins indicate profitability and efficient operations. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 94 and forward P/E of 63, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 179, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.31 and has demonstrated revenue and earnings growth.
