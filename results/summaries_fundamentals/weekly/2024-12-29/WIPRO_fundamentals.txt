Wipro Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and profit margins. The company's ROE of 16.71% and EBITDA margins of 19.49% indicate efficient use of shareholders' capital. However, the revenue growth rate of 1.3% is a concern, suggesting sluggish top-line expansion. The company's valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E of 10.48, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 23.12 is manageable. Overall, Wipro's strengths lie in its profitability, while its weakness is its slow revenue growth.
