Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 34.99 and a forward P/E of 25.93, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate is a concern, standing at a mere 0.04. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high at 7.287, which may be a weakness. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to focus on improving its revenue growth and debt management.
