Tata Motors Limited appears to be a moderately valued company with a trailing P/E ratio of 10.37, indicating potential upside. The company's profitability metrics are mixed, with decent gross margins and ROE, but low profit margins. A major concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 61.55, which may impact its financial flexibility. On the positive side, the company offers a decent dividend yield of 0.89%. Overall, Tata Motors' financial health is stable but not exceptional, with room for improvement in profitability and debt management.
