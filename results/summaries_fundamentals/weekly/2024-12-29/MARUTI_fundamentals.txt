Maruti Suzuki India Limited appears to be in a stable financial position, with strengths in its high gross margins (29.95%) and low debt-to-equity ratio (0.09). However, the company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (15.94%) and profit margins (9.48%), are moderate. The valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 27.36 and forward P/E of 24.17. A weakness is the negative earnings growth (-1%), which may be a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but it needs to improve its earnings growth to sustain investor confidence.
