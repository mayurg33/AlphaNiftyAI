Infosys Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong valuation, as indicated by its trailing and forward P/E ratios. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins, are also robust. However, the company's growth metrics, including revenue and earnings growth, are a concern. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively low, indicating a manageable debt position. Overall, Infosys' financial health is strong, but it needs to improve its growth momentum to sustain its valuation.
