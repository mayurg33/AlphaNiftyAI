Based on the provided metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and decent gross margins of 67.90%. However, its weaknesses lie in its declining revenue and earnings growth, with negative growth rates of -0.129 and -0.292, respectively. The company's valuation seems attractive with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but its forward P/E of 15.44 suggests potential overvaluation. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 indicates a high level of debt, which could be a concern.
