Hindalco Industries Limited appears to be in a stable financial position, with a low trailing P/E ratio of 9.31 and forward P/E ratio of 9.51, indicating undervaluation. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and EBITDA margins, are moderate, while gross margins are relatively high. However, profit margins are relatively low. The company's growth metrics are promising, with revenue and earnings growth rates of 15.9% and 67.2%, respectively. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 53.056, which may impact the company's financial flexibility. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but debt management is a key area to watch.
