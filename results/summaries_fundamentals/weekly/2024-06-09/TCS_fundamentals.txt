Tata Consultancy Services Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (38.34%) and decent profit margins (19.02%). The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 25.29 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.92. However, the company's revenue growth (5.3%) and earnings growth (-1.7%) are somewhat concerning. The debt-to-equity ratio is relatively low at 0.098, indicating a manageable debt position. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it may face some growth challenges ahead.
