HCL Technologies Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins and profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.42 and a forward P/E ratio of 24.09, indicating a moderate premium. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with low revenue and earnings growth rates. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.02 is also a weakness, indicating a high level of debt. On the positive side, the company's dividend yield of 4.23 is attractive, suggesting a regular income stream for investors.
