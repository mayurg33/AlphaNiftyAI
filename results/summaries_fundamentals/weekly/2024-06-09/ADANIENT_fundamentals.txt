Adani Enterprises Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are relatively low. However, its EBITDA margins and gross margins are decent. The revenue growth is negative, but earnings growth is strong at 11.97%. The company's valuation seems rich with a trailing P/E of 41.37 and forward P/E of 39.22. A major concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 162.60, indicating a significant debt burden.
