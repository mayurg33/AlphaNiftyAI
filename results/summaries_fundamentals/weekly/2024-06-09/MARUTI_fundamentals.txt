Maruti Suzuki India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (29.95%) and decent profit margins (9.48%). The company's return on equity (ROE) of 15.95% is also a positive sign. However, the company's earnings growth is a concern, with a decline of 1% reported. The valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 27.36 and forward P/E of 24.17. The company's debt position is comfortable, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.09, indicating a low level of indebtedness.
