ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE, EBITDA margins, and profit margins. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are moderate, but its dividend yield is attractive. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27. The debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, but not extremely low. Overall, ITC's strengths lie in its profitability and dividend yield, while its weaknesses include its high valuation and moderate growth rates.
