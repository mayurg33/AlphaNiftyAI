Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05 suggest undervaluation and attractive income potential. However, the negative revenue and earnings growth rates are concerning. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are moderate, while its debt-to-equity ratio is high at 9.15, indicating a leveraged balance sheet. Overall, the company's valuation is attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
