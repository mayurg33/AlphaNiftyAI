ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's growth metrics are also impressive, with a significant earnings growth rate and a decent dividend yield. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, which is not overly expensive. The debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, indicating a stable debt position.
