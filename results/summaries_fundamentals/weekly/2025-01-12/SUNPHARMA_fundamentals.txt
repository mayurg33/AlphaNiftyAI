Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and a decent profit margin of 20.79%. The company's high trailing P/E ratio of 36.48 and forward P/E ratio of 50.85 suggest that it may be overvalued. A major concern is the decline in earnings growth (-18.8%) and high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26, indicating potential liquidity issues. However, the company's return on equity (ROE) of 15.71% and dividend yield of 0.66% are positives. Overall, the company's financial health is mixed, with strengths in profitability and weaknesses in growth and debt management.
