JSW Steel Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high gross margin of 31.7% and a decent ROE of 4.33%, indicating efficient operations and profitability. However, the company's valuation is stretched, with a trailing P/E of 69.14, and its debt-to-equity ratio is high at 120.92, posing a risk. The revenue growth is also negative, which is a concern. On the positive side, the forward P/E is more reasonable at 14.27, and the dividend yield is attractive at 0.28%.
