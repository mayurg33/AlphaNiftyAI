Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (21.5%) and decent profit margins (5.52%). The company's revenue and earnings growth are also positive, indicating a growing business. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 91.56 and forward P/E of 61.05, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A major weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt levels.
