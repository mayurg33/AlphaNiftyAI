Nestl√© India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the packaged foods industry. Its high gross margins (55.89%) and profit margins (15.92%) indicate a strong pricing power and operational efficiency. However, the company's high trailing P/E ratio (70.15) and forward P/E ratio (58.04) suggest that it may be overvalued. A weakness is the negative earnings growth (-6.5%) and low revenue growth (4.5%). The company's debt-to-equity ratio (29.11) is manageable, and its dividend yield (1.69%) is attractive, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders.
