Coal India Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong dividend yield of 8.08% and a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.79, indicating undervaluation. The company's gross margins and profit margins are also respectable at 67.90% and 27.85%, respectively. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is relatively high, which may be a weakness. Overall, the company's financial health is mixed, with strengths in valuation and profitability, but weaknesses in growth and debt position.
