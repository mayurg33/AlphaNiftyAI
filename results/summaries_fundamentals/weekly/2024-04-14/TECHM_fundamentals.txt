Based on the metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 26.46, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low at 4%, which could be a concern. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is high at 7.29, which may impact its financial flexibility. Overall, the company's strengths lie in its profitability, while its weaknesses include slow revenue growth and high debt levels.
