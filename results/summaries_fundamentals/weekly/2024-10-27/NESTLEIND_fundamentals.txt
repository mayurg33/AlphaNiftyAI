Nestl√© India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins (55.89%) and decent profit margins (15.92%) indicate a profitable business model. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with revenue growth being sluggish (4.5%) and earnings growth being negative (-6.5%). The valuation appears to be rich, with a trailing P/E of 71.13 and forward P/E of 58.78. On the positive side, the company has a low debt-to-equity ratio of 29.11, indicating a manageable debt position.
