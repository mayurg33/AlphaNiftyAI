ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile demonstrated by its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth rate is relatively low at 4.7%, which could be a concern. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 suggests a moderate level of debt, which may impact its ability to invest in future growth initiatives.
