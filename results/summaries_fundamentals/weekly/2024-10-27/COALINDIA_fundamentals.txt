Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05% suggest undervaluation and attractiveness to income investors. Strengths include high gross margins of 67.9% and a decent ROE of 38.47%. However, weaknesses include declining revenue and earnings growth, and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15, indicating potential liquidity concerns. Overall, the company's valuation is relatively low, but its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
