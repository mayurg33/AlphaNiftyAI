Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strong growth prospects. Its high revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%) indicate a promising future. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and gross margins (35.4%), are also impressive. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86. The debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89 is a concern, but the dividend yield of 0.29% suggests a commitment to sharing profits with investors.
