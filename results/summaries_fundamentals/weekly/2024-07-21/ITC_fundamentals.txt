ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's growth metrics are also promising, with a notable earnings growth rate and a decent dividend yield. However, the valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 26.27. The debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, but not extremely low. Overall, ITC Limited's strengths lie in its profitability and growth, while its valuation and debt position are areas to monitor.
