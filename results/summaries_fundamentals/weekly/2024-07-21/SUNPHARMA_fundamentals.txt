Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and a decent profit margin of 20.79%. The company's return on equity (ROE) of 15.71% is also a positive sign. However, the company's earnings growth is a concern, with a decline of 18.8%. The valuation looks stretched, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and a forward P/E of 50.85. The debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a weakness, indicating a high level of debt.
