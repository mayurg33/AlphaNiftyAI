Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins. The company's earnings growth is also robust, with a growth rate of 76.4%. However, the revenue growth is relatively slow at 4%. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, but its debt-to-equity ratio is high at 7.29, which could be a concern. Overall, the company's strengths lie in its profitability and earnings growth, but its weaknesses include slow revenue growth and high debt levels.
