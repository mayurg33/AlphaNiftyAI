Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its profitability metrics, such as ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins, indicate a solid performance. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 27.38 and a forward P/E ratio of 22.66, suggesting potential for future growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability and valuation are offset by its high debt levels, which may impact its financial flexibility.
