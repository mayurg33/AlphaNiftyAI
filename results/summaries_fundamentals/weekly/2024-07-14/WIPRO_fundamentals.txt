Wipro Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and profit margins. The company's ROE and EBITDA margins also indicate efficient use of resources. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low, which could be a concern. The valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48, indicating potential for upside. The debt-to-equity ratio is moderate, but the dividend yield of 2.28% suggests a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. Overall, Wipro's financial health is strong, but it needs to focus on accelerating revenue growth.
