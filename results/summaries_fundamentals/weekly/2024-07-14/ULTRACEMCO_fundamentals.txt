UltraTech Cement Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (57.71%) and decent EBITDA margins (16.53%). However, its profitability metrics, such as ROE (9.00%) and profit margins (7.95%), are relatively low. The company's valuation is high, with a trailing P/E of 56.50 and forward P/E of 84.49, indicating that the market has high expectations for its future growth. The debt-to-equity ratio of 32.62 is manageable, but the company's growth metrics, such as revenue growth (13%) and earnings growth (7.7%), are moderate. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but its high valuation and moderate growth metrics warrant caution.
