Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue growth and earnings growth suggest a positive trajectory. However, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E ratio of 34.99 and a forward P/E ratio of 25.93. The debt-to-equity ratio of 7.287 is a concern, indicating a relatively high level of debt. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but it needs to address its high valuation and debt position.
