Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, indicate a decent ability to generate earnings. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 22.66, suggesting potential for future growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81 is a concern, indicating high leverage. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.81% and a strong book value of 690.16. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its high debt levels.
