UltraTech Cement Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strong profitability metrics, including a high gross margin of 57.71% and EBITDA margin of 16.53%. The company's ROE of 9.00% indicates efficient use of shareholders' equity. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 56.50 and forward P/E of 84.49, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 32.62% is a concern, but the company's dividend yield of 0.61% provides some comfort. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability are offset by weaknesses in valuation and debt position.
