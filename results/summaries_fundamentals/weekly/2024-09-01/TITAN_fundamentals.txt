Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the luxury goods industry. Its high profit margins (5.52%) and EBITDA margins (9.42%) indicate efficient operations. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are also promising, with a 19.4% revenue growth and 13.1% earnings growth. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 94.00 and forward P/E of 62.76, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74 is a concern, suggesting high leverage.
