Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue growth and earnings growth suggest a positive trend. However, the trailing P/E ratio is relatively high, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is also relatively high, which could be a concern. Overall, the company's financial health is strong, but investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt position.
