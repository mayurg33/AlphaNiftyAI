ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and a forward P/E of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 4.7% is relatively slow. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is manageable, and its dividend yield of 3.79% is attractive. Overall, ITC Limited's strengths lie in its profitability and dividend yield, while its weaknesses include slow revenue growth.
