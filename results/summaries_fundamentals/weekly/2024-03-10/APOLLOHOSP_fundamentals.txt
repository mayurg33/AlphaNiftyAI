Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and gross margins (35.4%), are also impressive. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86. A major weakness is its high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may pose a risk to its financial stability.
