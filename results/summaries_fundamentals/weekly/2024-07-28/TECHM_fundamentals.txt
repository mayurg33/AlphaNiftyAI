Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E of 25.93, which is lower than its trailing P/E. A significant strength is its high earnings growth rate of 76.4%. However, the company's revenue growth rate is a concern, standing at a mere 4%. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is relatively high, indicating a leveraged balance sheet.
