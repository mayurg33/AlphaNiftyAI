Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%). The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and gross margins (35.4%), are also respectable. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86. A notable weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's growth prospects and profitability are strong, but its valuation and debt position warrant caution.
