Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include decent revenue and earnings growth, as well as a reasonable dividend yield. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins, are also respectable. However, the company's valuation seems slightly rich, with a trailing P/E ratio of 27.38, which may indicate that the stock is overvalued. A notable weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 144.812, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability.
