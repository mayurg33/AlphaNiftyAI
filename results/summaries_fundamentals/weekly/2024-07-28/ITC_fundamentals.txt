ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth rate is relatively low at 4.7%. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is manageable, but could be improved. Overall, ITC Limited appears to be a stable company with a strong profitability profile, but with room for improvement in terms of revenue growth.
