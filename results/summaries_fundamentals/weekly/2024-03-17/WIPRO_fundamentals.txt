Wipro Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins and decent profit margins. The company's ROE and EBITDA margins are also respectable. However, its revenue growth is sluggish, which could be a concern. The valuation looks reasonable with a forward P/E of 10.48, suggesting potential upside. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is manageable, and its dividend yield is attractive. Overall, Wipro's financial health is stable, but it needs to improve its revenue growth to sustain its profitability.
