Nestl√© India Limited's financial health appears strong, with high gross margins (55.89%) and a decent ROE (8.73%). The company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 71.13 and forward P/E of 58.78, indicating that the market has high expectations. A key weakness is the negative earnings growth (-6.5%) and low revenue growth (4.5%). The company's debt-to-equity ratio is manageable at 29.11%, and it offers a decent dividend yield of 1.7%. Overall, the company's financial health is robust, but its high valuation and slow growth may be a concern for investors.
