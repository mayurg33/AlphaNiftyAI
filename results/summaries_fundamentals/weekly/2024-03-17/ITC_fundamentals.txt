ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and forward P/E of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate of 4.7% is relatively slow. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is manageable, and its dividend yield of 3.79% is attractive. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is strong, with a few areas for improvement.
