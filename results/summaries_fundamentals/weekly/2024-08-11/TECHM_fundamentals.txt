Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are modest, but its book value and dividend yield are respectable. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 34.99 and forward P/E of 25.93. A concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29, which may impact its financial flexibility. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability and growth are offset by its valuation and debt position.
