Maruti Suzuki India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high gross margins (29.95%) and profit margins (9.48%) indicate a competitive advantage in the auto manufacturing industry. The company's return on equity (ROE) of 15.94% is also impressive, suggesting efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are modest, and its valuation multiples (trailing P/E of 27.36 and forward P/E of 24.17) seem slightly elevated. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.09 is relatively low, indicating a conservative debt position.
