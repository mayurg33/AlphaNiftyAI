Based on the provided metrics, Coal India Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation. However, the company's weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating a decline in business performance. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is also a concern, suggesting high leverage. Overall, the company's valuation seems attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position are areas of concern.
