Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, reflected in its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low at 4%. A key strength is the company's dividend yield of 2.68%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. The debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a concern, suggesting that the company may need to address its debt position to maintain its financial health.
