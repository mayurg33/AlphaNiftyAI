ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, which is slightly lower than its trailing P/E ratio. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth is sluggish, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 is a weakness that needs to be monitored. Overall, ITC Limited appears to be a stable company with a strong profitability profile, but with some areas for improvement.
