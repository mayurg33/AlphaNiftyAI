Tata Consultancy Services Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profit margin of 19.02% and high gross margins of 38.34%. The company's return on equity (ROE) of 52.16% indicates efficient use of shareholders' capital. However, the revenue growth rate of 5.3% and earnings growth rate of -1.7% suggest a moderate growth pace. The company's valuation seems reasonable with a trailing P/E of 25.29 and forward P/E of 21.92. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.098 suggests a conservative debt position, indicating a low risk of default.
