Coal India Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong dividend yield of 8.05% and a low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84, indicating undervaluation. The company's high gross margins of 67.90% and EBITDA margins of 37.07% suggest a profitable business model. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are negative, indicating a decline in performance. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a concern, but the company's high ROE of 38.47% suggests it can manage its debt effectively. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its declining growth rates.
