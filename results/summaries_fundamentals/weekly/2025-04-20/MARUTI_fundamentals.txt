Maruti Suzuki India Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (29.95%) and return on equity (15.94%). The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 27.36 and forward P/E ratio of 24.17. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are relatively low, at 6.4% and -1%, respectively. The debt-to-equity ratio is low at 0.09, indicating a strong balance sheet. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but growth prospects may be a concern.
