Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its strengths include a high ROE of 31.75%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity, and a decent revenue growth rate of 19.4%. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 94.00 and a forward P/E of 62.76, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A concerning weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, the company's profitability margins are moderate, and its dividend yield is relatively low.
