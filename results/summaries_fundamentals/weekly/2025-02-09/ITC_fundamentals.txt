ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, evident from its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, indicating a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth rate of 4.7% is relatively low, which could be a concern. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 suggests a moderate level of debt, which may impact its financial flexibility. Overall, ITC Limited appears to be a stable company with a strong profitability profile, but with some areas for improvement.
