Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company. Its strengths include a high return on equity (ROE) of 15.48%, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital, and a decent dividend yield of 2.68%. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 34.99 and forward P/E of 25.93, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the low revenue growth rate of 4%, which may be a concern. The debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is relatively high, indicating a moderate level of debt, but the company's profitability metrics, such as EBITDA margins and profit margins, are decent. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but investors should be cautious due to the high valuation and moderate debt levels.
