Grasim Industries Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths lie in its high gross margins (57.88%) and moderate EBITDA margins (19.04%), indicating a decent profitability profile. However, its ROE (5.23%) and profit margins (2.50%) are relatively low, suggesting room for improvement. The company's valuation is steep, with a trailing P/E of 50.05 and forward P/E of 119.25, indicating that the market has high expectations. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 118.07 is a concern, indicating high leverage.
