Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and decent gross margins of 67.9%. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating a decline in business performance. The company's valuation seems attractive with a low trailing P/E of 6.84, but its forward P/E of 15.44 suggests potential overvaluation. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is fragile, and investors should exercise caution.
