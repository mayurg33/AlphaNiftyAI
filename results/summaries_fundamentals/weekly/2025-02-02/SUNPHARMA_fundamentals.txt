Based on the provided metrics, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to have a mixed financial health. The company's strengths include high gross margins (79.56%) and a decent dividend yield (0.66%). However, its weaknesses lie in its low ROE (15.71%) and negative earnings growth (-18.8%). The company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and a forward P/E of 50.85. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 3.259 indicates a high level of debt, which could be a concern.
