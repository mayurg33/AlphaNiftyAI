Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong brand presence in the luxury goods industry. Its high profit margins (5.52%) and EBITDA margins (9.42%) indicate efficient operations. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are moderate, with a decent dividend yield of 0.31%. However, the valuation looks stretched with a trailing P/E of 94.00 and forward P/E of 62.76, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may impact the company's financial flexibility.
