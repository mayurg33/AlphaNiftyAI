Tata Consumer Products Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in revenue growth (17.3%) and earnings growth (53.1%). The company's gross margins (41.86%) and profit margins (7.26%) are also respectable. However, the company's valuation is relatively high, with a trailing P/E of 84.62 and forward P/E of 74.14, indicating that the stock may be overpriced. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 11.186 is a weakness, suggesting that it may be overly reliant on debt financing. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but investors should be cautious of the high valuation and debt levels.
