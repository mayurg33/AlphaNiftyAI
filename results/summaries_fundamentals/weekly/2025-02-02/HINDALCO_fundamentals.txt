Hindalco Industries Limited appears to be in a stable financial position, with a low trailing P/E ratio of 9.31, indicating undervaluation. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and profit margins, are moderate, while its EBITDA margins and gross margins are relatively strong. A notable strength is its revenue growth of 15.9% and earnings growth of 67.2%. However, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 53.056 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but debt reduction efforts are necessary to improve its long-term sustainability.
