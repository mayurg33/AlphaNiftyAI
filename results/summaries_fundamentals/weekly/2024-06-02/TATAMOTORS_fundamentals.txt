Tata Motors Limited appears to be a moderately valued company with a trailing P/E ratio of 10.37, indicating a relatively affordable stock price. The company's profitability metrics are mixed, with a decent ROE of 21.08% and gross margins of 45.26%, but lower profit margins of 6.33%. A major concern is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 61.55, which may impact its financial flexibility. On the positive side, the company offers a decent dividend yield of 0.89%. Overall, Tata Motors' financial health is stable but not exceptional, with room for improvement in its debt management and profitability.
