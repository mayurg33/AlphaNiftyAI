Hindalco Industries Limited appears to be in a stable financial position, with a low trailing P/E ratio of 9.31 and forward P/E ratio of 9.51, indicating undervaluation. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE and EBITDA margins, are moderate, while gross margins are relatively high. However, profit margins are relatively low. The company's growth metrics are promising, with revenue and earnings growth rates of 15.9% and 67.2%, respectively. Nevertheless, the debt-to-equity ratio of 53.06 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but debt reduction efforts are necessary to improve its financial position.
