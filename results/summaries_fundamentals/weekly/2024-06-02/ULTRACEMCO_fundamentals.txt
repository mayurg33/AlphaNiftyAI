UltraTech Cement Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with strengths in its high gross margins (57.71%) and decent EBITDA margins (16.53%). However, its profitability metrics, such as ROE (9.00%) and profit margins (7.95%), are relatively low. The company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 56.50 and a forward P/E of 84.49, indicating that the market has high expectations for its future performance. The debt-to-equity ratio of 32.62 is manageable, but the company's growth metrics, including revenue and earnings growth, are relatively slow. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but its valuation and growth prospects may be concerns for investors.
