Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and profit margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue and earnings growth rates suggest a stable growth trajectory. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, which is lower than its trailing P/E ratio. Overall, the company's financial health is strong, but it needs to address its high debt levels to improve its overall financial position.
