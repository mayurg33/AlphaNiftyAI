Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile reflected in its high gross margins and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 22.66, indicating potential for future growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81 is a concern, suggesting high leverage. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.81% and a strong book value per share of 690.16. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but debt reduction efforts are necessary to improve its long-term sustainability.
