Adani Enterprises Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's strengths include a high earnings growth rate of 11.957% and a decent ROE of 15.93%. However, its revenue growth is negative, and profit margins are relatively low. The company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 41.37 and forward P/E of 39.22. A major concern is its high debt-to-equity ratio of 162.597, indicating a significant debt burden. Overall, the company's financial health is vulnerable due to its high debt levels and negative revenue growth.
