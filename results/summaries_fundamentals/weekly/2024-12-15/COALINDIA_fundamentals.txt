Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. Strengths include a high dividend yield of 8.05% and robust gross margins of 67.9%. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating a decline in business performance. The company's valuation is relatively low, with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but its forward P/E of 15.44 suggests potential growth. The debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is a concern, indicating high leverage. Overall, the company's financial health is stable but faces challenges in its core business.
