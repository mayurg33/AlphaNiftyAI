Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high profit margins (5.52%) and gross margins (21.5%) indicate a competitive advantage in the luxury goods industry. However, the company's valuation is steep, with a trailing P/E ratio of 94.00 and forward P/E ratio of 62.76, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A notable weakness is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Despite this, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are respectable, and its dividend yield of 0.31% provides some income potential for investors.
