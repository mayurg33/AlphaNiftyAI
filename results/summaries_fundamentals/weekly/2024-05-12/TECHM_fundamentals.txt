Based on the provided metrics, Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with some strengths and weaknesses. The company's high ROE and EBITDA margins indicate strong profitability, while its revenue growth and earnings growth suggest a positive trend. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E of 25.93, but the trailing P/E of 34.99 is somewhat elevated. Overall, the company's financial health is positive, but it needs to address its high debt levels.
