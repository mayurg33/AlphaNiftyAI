Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited appears to be a financially stable company with a strong gross margin of 79.56% and EBITDA margin of 28.69%. The company's ROE of 15.71% indicates decent profitability. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, with a decline in earnings growth. The valuation seems stretched with a trailing P/E of 36.48 and forward P/E of 50.85. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 3.26 is a concern, but its dividend yield of 0.66% provides some comfort.
