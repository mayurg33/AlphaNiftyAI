However, weaknesses include declining revenue and earnings growth, and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15. The company's valuation is relatively low, with a trailing P/E of 6.84, but its forward P/E is higher at 15.44. Overall, the company's profitability metrics are decent, but its growth metrics and debt position are concerning.
