Mahindra & Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company, with a strong profitability profile reflected in its high gross margins and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 27.38 and forward P/E of 22.66, indicating a moderate premium. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 144.81 is a concern, suggesting high leverage. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.81 and a strong book value of 690.16. Overall, the company's financial health is good, but debt reduction efforts are necessary to improve its balance sheet.
