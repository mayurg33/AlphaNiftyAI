ITC Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evidenced by its high gross margins, profit margins, and ROE. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E of 26.27 and a forward P/E of 21.87, indicating a potential for future growth. A key strength is its high dividend yield of 3.79%, suggesting a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. However, the company's revenue growth is sluggish, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.404 may be a concern. Overall, ITC Limited's financial health is strong, but it needs to improve its revenue growth and debt management.
