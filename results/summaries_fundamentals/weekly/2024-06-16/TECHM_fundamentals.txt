Tech Mahindra Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong profitability profile, as evident from its high ROE and decent profit margins. The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.93, indicating potential for future growth. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 7.29 is a concern, indicating high leverage. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 2.68% and a strong book value of 308.86. Overall, the company's financial health is stable, but it needs to work on reducing its debt burden.
