Bajaj Auto Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in its high gross margins (32.99%) and decent profit margins (13.96%). The company's return on equity (ROE) of 22.84% indicates efficient use of shareholder capital. However, the company's valuation seems stretched with a trailing P/E of 31.99 and forward P/E of 48.93, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A weakness is the negative earnings growth (-9.6%) and moderate revenue growth (10.8%). The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 26.25 is manageable, but not ideal.
