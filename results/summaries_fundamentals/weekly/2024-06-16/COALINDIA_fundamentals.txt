Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio and high dividend yield suggest undervaluation, while its high gross margins and profit margins indicate a strong profitability profile. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth are negative, indicating challenges in its core business. Additionally, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, suggesting potential liquidity issues. Overall, the company's strengths in profitability are offset by weaknesses in growth and debt management.
