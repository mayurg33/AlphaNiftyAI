Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with strengths in revenue growth (13.1%) and earnings growth (53.5%), indicating a strong top-line and bottom-line performance. The company's profitability metrics, such as ROE (18.85%) and gross margins (35.4%), are also respectable. However, the company's valuation seems stretched, with a trailing P/E of 69.43 and forward P/E of 85.86, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 90.89 is a concern, indicating high leverage.
