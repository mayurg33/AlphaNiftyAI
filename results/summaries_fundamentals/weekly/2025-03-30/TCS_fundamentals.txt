The company's valuation seems reasonable, with a trailing P/E ratio of 25.29 and a forward P/E ratio of 21.92, indicating a moderate premium. However, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with revenue growth and earnings growth being relatively low. The debt-to-equity ratio is also relatively low, indicating a comfortable debt position. Overall, the company's strengths lie in its profitability, while its weaknesses are in its growth metrics.
