Coal India Limited's financial health appears mixed. The company's low trailing P/E ratio of 6.84 and high dividend yield of 8.05% suggest it may be undervalued. Strengths include high gross margins of 67.9% and a strong ROE of 38.47%. However, weaknesses include negative revenue and earnings growth, indicating challenges in its core business. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 9.15 is also a concern, suggesting high leverage. Overall, the company's valuation appears attractive, but its growth prospects and debt position warrant caution.
