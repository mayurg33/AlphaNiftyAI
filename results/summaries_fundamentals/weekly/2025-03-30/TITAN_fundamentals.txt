Titan Company Limited appears to be a financially healthy company with a strong market capitalization. Its high ROE and gross margins indicate efficient operations and profitability. However, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 94.00 and forward P/E of 62.76, suggesting that the stock may be overpriced. A concerning aspect is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. On the positive side, the company has a decent dividend yield of 0.31 and has demonstrated moderate revenue and earnings growth.
