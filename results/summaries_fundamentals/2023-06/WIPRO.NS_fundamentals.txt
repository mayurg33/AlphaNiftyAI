Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY for Wipro Limited. Here's why:

* The forward PE ratio is significantly lower than the trailing PE ratio, indicating that the market expects the company's earnings to improve in the future.
* The ROE and profit margin are decent, indicating that the company is generating profits from its equity and operations.
* The revenue growth and earnings growth are positive, indicating that the company is expanding its operations.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is relatively low, indicating that the company has a manageable debt burden.

Overall, the company appears to be undervalued based on its future earnings potential and its solid financial health. A BUY recommendation is warranted.
