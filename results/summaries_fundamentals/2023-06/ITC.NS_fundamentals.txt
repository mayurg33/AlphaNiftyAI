Based on the data, I would recommend a BUY for ITC Limited. Here's a brief justification:

* The Profit Margin of 46.13% is significantly high, indicating the company's ability to maintain its profitability.
* The ROE of 27.58% is also impressive, suggesting that the company is generating strong returns for its shareholders.
* The Earnings Growth rate of 2.84% indicates a steady increase in profitability, which can lead to a potential increase in stock price.
* The Debt/Equity ratio of 0.404 is manageable, indicating that the company is not over-leveraged.
* The Forward PE of 21.94 is relatively lower than the Trailing PE, indicating a potential undervaluation of the stock.

Overall, the strong profitability, steady earnings growth, and relatively low valuation make a strong case for a BUY recommendation.
