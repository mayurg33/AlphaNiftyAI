I would recommend SELL for the following reasons:

1. **Overvalued**: The trailing PE is 91.35, which is significantly higher than the forward PE of 60.91, indicating that the stock is trading at a premium valuation**. 
2. **High Debt**: The debt-to-equity ratio of 178.74 is alarming, signifying that the company is carrying a substantial amount of debt, which may lead to liquidity issues in the future.
3. **Average Profit Margin**: The profit margin of 0.0552 is average, which does not justify the high PE multiple.
4. **Slow Earnings Growth**: The earnings growth rate of 0.131 is slower than the revenue growth rate of 0.194, which may indicate that the company is struggling to convert its revenue growth into profit growth.

Considering these factors, I would recommend selling the stock to avoid potential losses.
