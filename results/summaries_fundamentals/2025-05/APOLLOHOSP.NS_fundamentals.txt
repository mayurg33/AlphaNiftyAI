To recommend a course of action for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, I'll analyze the provided data using a chain of thoughts.

**Step 1: Valuation**
Trailing PE (69.42) and Forward PE (85.86) are both higher than the industry average, indicating that the stock might be overvalued. This could be a concern, as high valuations may not be sustainable in the long run.

**Step 2: Profitability**
ROE (18.85%) is relatively low, which might indicate that the company is not utilizing its equity efficiently. Profit Margin (6.63%) is also relatively low, suggesting that the company may not have a significant competitive advantage.

**Step 3: Growth**
Revenue Growth (13.1%) and Earnings Growth (53.5%) are both positive, indicating that the company is expanding its business and improving its profitability.

**Step 4: Leverage**
Debt/Equity ratio (90.89) is high, which could be a concern, as excessive debt can increase the risk of default and negatively impact the company's financial health.

**Overall Analysis**
Considering the high valuation, low profitability, and high leverage, I would recommend a **HOLD** for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited. While the company's growth prospects are promising, the other factors mentioned above might outweigh the benefits of growth. A HOLD recommendation means that I would not advise buying or selling the stock at this point, but rather monitor the company's performance and wait for a more favorable entry or exit point.
