Based on the metrics, I would recommend a BUY, as the short-term returns are trending positive (9.56% in 3M) and the volatility is relatively low (0.29), indicating a potential upward momentum. The high Sharpe Ratio (0.98) also suggests that the stock's excess return is high compared to its risk, making it an attractive investment opportunity.
