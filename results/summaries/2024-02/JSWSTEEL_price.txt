Based on the metrics, I would recommend a HOLD on JSWSTEEL. The stock has shown a decent long-term return of 9.33% over the past 12 months, and the Sharpe Ratio of 0.83 indicates that the returns have been reasonably stable, but the recent 3-month dip suggests caution before making a buy or sell decision.
