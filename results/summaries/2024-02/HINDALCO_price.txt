I would recommend a HOLD on HINDALCO, as the stock has shown some recent resilience with a positive 6M return, despite a weak 3M performance, and the volatility is relatively low. The Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns, is also decent, suggesting that the returns are somewhat justified by the risk taken.
