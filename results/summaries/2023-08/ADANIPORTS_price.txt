I would recommend a BUY on ADANIPORTS stock, given its impressive short-term returns and relatively low volatility, indicating a potential for sustained growth. The Sharpe Ratio of 1.23 further supports this decision, suggesting that the stock's returns are likely to be driven by fundamental factors rather than just market fluctuations.
