I would recommend a BUY on SUNPHARMA, as the stock has shown strong long-term performance with a 13.58% 12-month return, and its high Sharpe Ratio of 1.47 indicates that the returns are generated with relatively low volatility. The recent short-term downturns are likely a buying opportunity, considering the stock's overall strong fundamentals.
