Based on these metrics, I would recommend a HOLD on WIPRO. The stock's 12-month return is positive, but the recent 6-month and 3-month returns are negative, indicating a potential short-term correction, and the Sharpe Ratio of 0.66 suggests that the returns are not significantly higher than the risk taken.
