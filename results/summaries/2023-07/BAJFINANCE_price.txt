Based on the strong returns across all timeframes (40.16% in 12M, 34.36% in 6M, and 12.88% in 3M) and a decent Sharpe Ratio of 1.00 indicating a good balance between risk and return, I would recommend a **BUY**. The relatively low volatility of 0.25 also suggests that the stock's price movements are not excessively erratic.
