I would recommend a BUY on AXISBANK, as the stock has shown a strong momentum with a 19.36% return in the last 3 months, and a decent Sharpe Ratio of 0.78, indicating a good balance between risk and return. The low volatility of 0.23 also suggests that the stock has the potential to continue its upward trend.
