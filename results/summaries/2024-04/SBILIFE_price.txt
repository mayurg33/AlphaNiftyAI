I would recommend a BUY on SBILIFE stock, given its strong returns over various time frames (23.14% in 12 months, 25.79% in 6 months, and 26.68% in 3 months) and a relatively low volatility of 0.23. The Sharpe Ratio of 1.02 also indicates a good risk-adjusted return, further supporting a BUY decision.
