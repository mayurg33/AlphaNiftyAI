Based on the metrics, I would recommend a HOLD on HINDALCO, as the 6M return is positive, indicating a recent upward trend, but the 3M return is negative, suggesting a need to monitor the stock's performance closely. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.84 is relatively healthy, indicating that the returns are justified by the level of risk taken.
