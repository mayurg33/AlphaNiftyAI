I would recommend a BUY on SHRIRAMFIN due to its impressive return profile, with consistent upside momentum over the past year, and a relatively low volatility. The Sharpe Ratio of 1.52 also indicates that the returns are not driven by excessive risk-taking, making it an attractive investment opportunity.
