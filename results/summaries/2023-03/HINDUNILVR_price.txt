Based on the metrics, I would recommend a HOLD on HINDUNILVR. The recent 3-month return of 6.63% is a positive sign, and the Sharpe Ratio of 0.02 indicates that the returns are somewhat stable, but the overall 12-month return of -7.71% suggests that there may be underlying issues that need to be watched closely.
