Based on the metrics, I would recommend a BUY on HCLTECH stock has a strong long-term performance with a 22.14% return over the past year, and a decent short-term bounce back with an 11.74% return over the past 3 months, indicating a potential upward trend. The volatility of 0.24 and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.09 suggest that the returns are relatively stable and efficient, further supporting a BUY decision.
