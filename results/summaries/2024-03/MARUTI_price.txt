I would recommend a HOLD on MARUTI. The stock has shown a positive trend in the short term with a 12.77% return over 6 months and a 7.77% return over 3 months, indicating momentum, while the Sharpe Ratio of 0.91 suggests that the returns are driven by smart investment decisions rather than unnecessary risk-taking.
