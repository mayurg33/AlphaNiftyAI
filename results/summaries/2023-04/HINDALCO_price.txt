Based on these metrics, I would recommend a HOLD on HINDALCO, as the short-term returns are negative, but the Sharpe Ratio indicates that the returns are relatively stable and in line with the volatility. Additionally, the 6M return is positive, suggesting that the decline in the 3M return may be a short-term blip.
