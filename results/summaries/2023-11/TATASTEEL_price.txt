Based on the metrics, I recommend a HOLD on TATASTEEL. The negative 12-month return is concerning, but the recent 6-month and 3-month performances are encouraging, suggesting a potential turnaround, and the Sharpe Ratio of 0.86 indicates that the returns are somewhat justified by the level of risk taken.
