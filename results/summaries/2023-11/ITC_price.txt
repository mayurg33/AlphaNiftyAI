Based on the metrics, I would recommend a HOLD position in ITC. The negative 12-month and 6-month returns are concerning, but the recent 3-month return suggests some improvement, and the low volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock's returns are relatively stable and aligned with its risk.
