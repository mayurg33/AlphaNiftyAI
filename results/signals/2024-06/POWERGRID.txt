Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite underperforming in the last 12 months, the positive news sentiment and strong macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector and rural consumption, suggest a potential turnaround for POWERGRID. The HOLD recommendation based on technicals is overridden by the positive news sentiment and favorable macro conditions.
