  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past year, with a 12-month return of -12.81%, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers indicates that the stock is likely to follow the trend of the industry, which may not be positive in the current market conditions. The macroeconomic environment, although showing some positive signs, is not strong enough to outweigh the stock's fundamental weaknesses."
