  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has shown strong price trends with a 12-month return of 8.54% and a low volatility of 0.245. The Sharpe Ratio of 4.802 indicates a high risk-adjusted return. Although the fundamentals suggest a HOLD due to expensive valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio, the macroeconomic environment is supportive with a growing services sector, low inflation, and stable interest rates. This outweighs the concerns, leading to a BUY recommendation."
