  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has demonstrated strong performance with a 10.70% return over the past 12 months, low volatility, and an attractive Sharpe Ratio. The fundamentals are also supportive, with a low forward PE ratio, reasonable profitability, and steady growth. Although the macroeconomic environment is neutral, the company's expansion into the global consumer healthcare business is a positive development, outweighing the concerns around the USFDA's form 483."
