Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's poor price performance and high valuation, the strong news sentiment and positive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector and manufacturing, suggest that ADANIPORTS has potential for growth. Additionally, the company's robust profitability and growth profile, as indicated by its ROE and revenue growth, support a BUY signal.
