Signal: BUY
Reason: Wipro's strong price trend, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio indicate a robust upward momentum, while its decent valuation, reasonable profitability, and manageable debt levels suggest a strong fundamental base. The macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and improving rural consumption, also supports the company's growth prospects.
