  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock has been underperforming with a negative return and Sharpe Ratio, indicating poor risk-return profile. However, the positive news sentiment and strong macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector and consumer behavior, suggest potential for growth. Given the mixed signals, a HOLD recommendation is justified, pending further monitoring of the stock's performance and sector trends."
