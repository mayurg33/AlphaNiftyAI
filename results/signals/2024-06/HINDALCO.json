  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's low valuation, decent profitability, and strong growth prospects outweigh the concern about the high debt-to-equity ratio. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a stable repo rate, growing private consumption, and a strong automotive industry. Additionally, the neutral news sentiment and moderate to high correlations with peers suggest that the stock is not overly influenced by short-term market trends."
