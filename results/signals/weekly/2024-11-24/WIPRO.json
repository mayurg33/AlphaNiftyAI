  "reasoning": "Wipro's decent weekly performance and moderate risk profile are positives. However, its underperformance compared to peers and slow revenue growth are concerns. The company's strong profitability and reasonable valuation are strengths, but the news sentiment, although positive, is not strong enough to warrant a buy decision. Overall, a hold decision is recommended, pending improvement in revenue growth and peer outperformance."
