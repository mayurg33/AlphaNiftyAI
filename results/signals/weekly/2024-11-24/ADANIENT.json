  "reasoning": "The stock's dismal weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high level of risk. Additionally, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and rich valuation are significant concerns. The news sentiment is also overwhelmingly negative, which could lead to further decline in stock price."
