  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 43.58,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.03,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative returns make it an unattractive investment option for the week. However, the company's financial health is stable, with a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment also support the stock. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further developments to improve the stock's risk-adjusted returns."
