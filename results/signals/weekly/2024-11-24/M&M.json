  "sharpe_ratio": 0.92,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance is decent, but its high volatility is a concern. The company's financial health is stable, but it needs to work on reducing its debt burden. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but the penalty news has a neutral impact. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock and recommend a HOLD decision."
