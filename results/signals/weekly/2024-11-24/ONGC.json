  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 30.51,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.35,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, its strong valuation, high dividend yield, and decent ROE are positives. The mixed news sentiment and macroeconomic environment do not provide a clear direction. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further developments to clarify the stock's direction."
