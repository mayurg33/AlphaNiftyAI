Fundamentally, the company is financially healthy with high gross margins and EBITDA margins, and a strong track record of growth. Although the valuation appears to be rich, the company's low debt-to-equity ratio and strong balance sheet support its financial health. The overall news sentiment is positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth."
