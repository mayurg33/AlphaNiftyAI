  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.32,
  "reasoning": "The stock's lackluster weekly performance and high volatility indicate caution. Although the company's financial health appears stable, the high valuation and negative earnings growth are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but the automotive industry's growth is not exceptional. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and uncertainties outweigh its potential benefits."
