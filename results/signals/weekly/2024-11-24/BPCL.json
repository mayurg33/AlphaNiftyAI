  "sharpe_ratio": -0.25,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, negative news sentiment, and historical data suggesting a negative price impact all contribute to a sell decision. Additionally, the company's mixed financial health, with weaknesses in revenue and earnings growth, as well as a high debt-to-equity ratio, further support this decision. While the stock's valuation is relatively attractive, the overall risks outweigh the potential benefits."
