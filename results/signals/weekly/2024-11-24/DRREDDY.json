  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 28.64,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.33,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively risky investment. While the company's financial health is good, with strong profitability and attractive valuation, its high debt levels are a concern. The news sentiment is mixed to negative, and the macroeconomic environment is stable but not exceptionally strong. Therefore, I would recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential upside is offset by its risks."
