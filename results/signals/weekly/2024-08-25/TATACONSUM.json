  "volatility": 22.8,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.29,
  "reasoning": "The stock has a strong weekly return of 1.65% and a decent Sharpe Ratio of 0.29, indicating a justified return for the level of risk taken. However, the high volatility of 22.8% and maximum drawdown of -0.75% suggest caution. Furthermore, the company's fundamentals are strong, but the valuation is on the higher side, and the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. Given these mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
