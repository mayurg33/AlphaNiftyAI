  "sharpe_ratio": -0.07,
  "reasoning": "NTPC's financial stability and reasonable valuation are positives, but high debt-to-equity ratio and slow revenue growth are concerns. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, which may impact the stock price. Given the mixed signals, I would hold the stock for now, awaiting further developments."
