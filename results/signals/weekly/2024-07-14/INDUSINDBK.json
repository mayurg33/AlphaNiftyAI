  "volatility": 6.94,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.14,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was lackluster, with a return of -0.24%, and the Sharpe Ratio suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for its risk. The fundamentals indicate a mixed financial health with high profit margin and decent dividend yield, but also high trailing P/E ratio and decline in revenue growth. The news sentiment is NEGATIVE, which may put downward pressure on the stock price."
