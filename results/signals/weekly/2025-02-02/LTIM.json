  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 29.66,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.42,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate outperformance and good risk-adjusted return suggest a HOLD decision. However, the high volatility and rich valuation are concerns. The positive news sentiment and strong fundamentals, including profitability and growth, support the HOLD decision, but investors should be cautious of the debt position and valuation."
