  "reasoning": "Wipro's poor weekly performance is a concern, but its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. However, the low revenue growth rate and moderate debt levels are weaknesses. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's high volatility and unattractive risk-return profile make it a risky investment."
