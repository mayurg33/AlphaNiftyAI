  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and mediocre Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively risky investment. However, the company's financial health is good, with a strong market capitalization and decent profitability. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, with a mix of positive and negative reactions to Budget 2025. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's high volatility and mediocre risk-adjusted performance outweigh the positive news sentiment and financial health."
