  "sharpe_ratio": -0.31,
  "reasoning": "BPCL's weekly performance was disappointing with a return of -2.16% and a max drawdown of -2.16%. The stock's volatility is moderate, but the Sharpe ratio is negative, indicating that the return is not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Additionally, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative revenue and earnings growth, and a high debt-to-equity ratio. Therefore, it is recommended to sell the stock."
