  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": 0.51,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate performance and relatively low volatility suggest a stable investment. However, the high P/E ratio and debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The positive news sentiment and strong fundamentals, such as high gross margins and EBITDA margins, support a hold decision. The macroeconomic environment, with a strong services sector and growing private consumption, also supports a hold."
