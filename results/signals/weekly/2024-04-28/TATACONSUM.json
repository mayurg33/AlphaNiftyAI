  "reasoning": "The stock has a dismal weekly performance with a return of -5.83%, significantly underperforming its peers. The high volatility of 41.7% contributes to its poor performance, making it a risky investment. Additionally, the news sentiment is neutral to negative, with the company's Q4 results being below estimates, which may lead to further decline in stock price."
