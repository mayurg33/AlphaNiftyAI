  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 7.28,
  "sharpe_ratio": 1.19,
  "reasoning": "ONGC's strong weekly performance, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively safe bet. The company's financially stable position, with a strong dividend yield and moderate profitability metrics, supports a buy decision. Although the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, the overall sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is favorable, with a growing services sector and easing inflation."
