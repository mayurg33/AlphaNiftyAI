  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,

  "sharpe_ratio": 0.58,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong growth trajectory and profitability are overshadowed by its high debt levels, which need to be monitored. The neutral news sentiment and mixed historical impact on the stock price add to the uncertainty. However, the macroeconomic environment suggests a stable growth outlook, which could support the stock's performance. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarification on the company's debt situation and its impact on the stock price."
