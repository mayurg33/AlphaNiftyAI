  "sharpe_ratio": 0.11,
  "reasoning": "The stock has a decent weekly return of 0.98% and a positive news sentiment driven by strong quarterly results and a joint venture announcement. However, the high volatility and rich valuation metrics (P/E of 70.15) warrant caution. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with a strong services sector and easing inflation, but the company's growth metrics are a concern. Overall, I recommend a hold stance, as the stock's potential upside is balanced by its high volatility and valuation risks."
