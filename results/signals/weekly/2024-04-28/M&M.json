  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance this week, with a return of -2.19% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.29, indicates poor risk-adjusted returns. The news sentiment is predominantly negative due to the fraud detection and deferment of Q4 results, which has led to a significant decline in the company's share price. Although the company's fundamentals appear strong, the high debt-to-equity ratio and negative news sentiment outweigh the positives, making it a sell decision."
