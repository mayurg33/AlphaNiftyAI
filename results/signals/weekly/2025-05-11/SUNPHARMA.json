  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 9.08,
  "sharpe_ratio": -2.22,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and low Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's strong gross margin and EBITDA margin suggest efficient operations. The positive news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment could lead to a potential increase in the stock price, but the stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. Therefore, a hold decision is recommended."
