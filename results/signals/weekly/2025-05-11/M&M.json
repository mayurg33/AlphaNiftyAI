  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative returns make it a concerning investment. The company's high debt-to-equity ratio and valuation on the higher side are also red flags. Although the company's growth metrics are moderate, the mixed news sentiment with a slightly negative bias due to the rights issue announcements further supports a sell decision."
