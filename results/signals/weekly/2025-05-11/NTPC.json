  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 14.53,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.10,
  "reasoning": "NTPC's financial stability and strong valuation profile are positives, but high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The stock's recent underperformance and moderate risk level also warrant caution. However, the macroeconomic environment suggests stable growth and low inflation, which could support the stock's performance. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further improvement in the company's debt situation and stock performance."
