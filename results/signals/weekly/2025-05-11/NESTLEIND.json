  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 14.5,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.03,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate volatility and relatively low Sharpe Ratio indicate a cautious approach. While Nestl√© India's strong brand presence and efficient operations are positives, the high P/E ratios and negative earnings growth are concerns. In the current macroeconomic environment, with stable rural spending and moderate inflation, the stock's performance is expected to be steady, but not exceptional. Hence, a HOLD decision is recommended."
