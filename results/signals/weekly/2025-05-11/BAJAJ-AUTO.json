  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 13.26,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.91,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, with a return of -3.0% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.91, indicates poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's high valuation, declining earnings growth, and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerning. The negative news sentiment and slipping market share also suggest a potential decline in the stock price. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock."
