  "sharpe_ratio": -0.77,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's high valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio pose a risk to its financial stability. Although the company has strengths in revenue and earnings growth, the risks outweigh the benefits, leading to a SELL decision."
