  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 17.69,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.59,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns and moderate volatility indicate a cautious approach. While the company's fundamentals are strong, its valuation is stretched, and debt position is a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, and the macroeconomic environment is stable but not particularly supportive. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision with moderate confidence."
