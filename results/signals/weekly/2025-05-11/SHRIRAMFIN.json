  "sharpe_ratio": -0.46,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor performance this week are concerns, but the company's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest that it may be undervalued. The positive news sentiment and potential increase in stock price due to the acquisition of SOIPL and RBI nod for primary dealership business are positives. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and stagnant revenue growth are negatives that need to be monitored."
