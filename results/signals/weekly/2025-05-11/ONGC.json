  "sharpe_ratio": -0.30,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, but its volatility is moderate. Fundamentally, the company appears financially stable with a strong valuation, but growth and debt concerns exist. The news sentiment is positive, and the macroeconomic environment is stable. Considering these mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
