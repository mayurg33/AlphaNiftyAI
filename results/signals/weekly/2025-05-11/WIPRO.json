  "reasoning": "Wipro's stock has underperformed its peers with a return of -0.64% and high volatility. Although the company has a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation, its revenue growth rate is a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, and the macroeconomic environment is stable, but not exceptionally strong. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and weaknesses outweigh its strengths."
