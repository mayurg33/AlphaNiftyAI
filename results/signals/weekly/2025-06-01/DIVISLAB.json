  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 5.88,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.26,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility suggest caution. However, the company's strong financial health, with high gross margins and EBITDA margins, and low debt-to-equity ratio, are positives. The news sentiment is overall positive for the pharma sector, but the stock's high valuation is a concern. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and rewards are balanced."
