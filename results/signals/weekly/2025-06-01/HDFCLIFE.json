  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 20.06,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a riskier investment. Although the company's financial health is stable, the valuation is stretched and debt position is a concern. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment are encouraging, but not strong enough to outweigh the concerns. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision."
