  "sharpe_ratio": -0.88,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and moderate volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong financial health, with high gross margins and profit margins, suggests it has the potential to bounce back. The mixed news sentiment and neutral macroeconomic environment also support a hold decision. Further analysis is needed to determine if the stock's growth challenges and debt position can be addressed."
