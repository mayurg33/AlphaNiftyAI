  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 19.59,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.48,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. The company's financial health is strong, but its growth prospects are sluggish, and the valuation is rich. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, and the macroeconomic environment is stable but not particularly favorable. Therefore, it's a good time to sell the stock."
