  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 10.77,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.99,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong dividend yield and low P/E ratio suggest undervaluation. The company's financial health is stable, but growth concerns and high debt-to-equity ratio are weaknesses. The mixed news sentiment and neutral macroeconomic environment do not provide a clear direction, hence a hold decision."
