  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.26,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns this week are concerning. However, the company's strong fundamentals, such as high ROE and decent profit margins, suggest a stable business model. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, with the bonus issue likely to offset the negative impact of the promoter stake sale. Given the mixed signals, a HOLD decision is recommended."
