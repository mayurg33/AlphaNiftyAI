  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 19.63,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.13,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was relatively resilient, but high volatility and a negative Sharpe Ratio suggest a risky investment environment. Fundamentals are mixed, with strong revenue and earnings growth, but high valuation and debt levels. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, and the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but not strong enough to overcome the stock's weaknesses. Therefore, a hold decision is recommended."
