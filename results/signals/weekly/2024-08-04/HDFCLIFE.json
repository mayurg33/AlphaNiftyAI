  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. The company's high valuation and debt position are also concerns. Furthermore, the negative news sentiment and penalty imposed by IRDAI may lead to a decline in stock price. Overall, the risks outweigh the potential benefits, making it a SELL decision."
