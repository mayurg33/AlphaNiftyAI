  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 16.21,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.12,
  "reasoning": "The stock's volatility is high, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating a riskier investment. However, the company's profitability and valuation are strengths, and the news sentiment is neutral to negative. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential upside is not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken."
