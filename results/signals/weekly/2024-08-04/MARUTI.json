  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 50.47,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.00,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment environment. However, the company's strong financial health, respectable ROE and EBITDA margins, and reasonable valuation suggest a solid foundation. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, with potential upside from the company's efforts in the low-cost car segment and electric car launch. Given the mixed signals, a HOLD decision is recommended."
