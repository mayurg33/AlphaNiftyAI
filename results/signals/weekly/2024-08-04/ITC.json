  "sharpe_ratio": -0.33,
  "reasoning": "ITC's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerning, but its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, which may lead to short-term downward pressure. However, the company's high dividend yield and recommendation by Motilal Oswal provide some support. Overall, it's a HOLD decision, as the stock's fundamentals are strong, but the current market sentiment is uncertain."
