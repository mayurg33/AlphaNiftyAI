  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 43.99,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.02,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment environment. The company's financial health is good, but its high valuation and debt levels are concerns. The negative news sentiment and potential supply disruptions due to the surrender of the iron ore block lease further support a sell decision."
