  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a riskier investment. Although the company's financial health is good, with high EBITDA and gross margins, the high debt-to-equity ratio and rich valuation are concerns. The positive news sentiment and strong macroeconomic environment are offset by the mediocre weekly performance, leading to a hold decision."
