  "reasoning": "ITC's stable weekly performance and moderate volatility indicate a relatively low-risk investment. The company's strong profitability profile, reasonable valuation, and consistent earnings growth are positives. However, the revenue growth rate is a concern. The neutral news sentiment and macroeconomic environment suggest no strong catalysts for a significant price movement, making a hold decision reasonable."
