  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 12.15,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.01,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health appears strong, with high gross margins and profit margins, and a promising earnings growth rate. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The stock's volatility is moderate, and the Sharpe Ratio is low, indicating a higher level of risk. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarification on the company's debt management and its impact on future performance."
