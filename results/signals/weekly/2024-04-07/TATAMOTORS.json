  "volatility": 11.07,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.54,
  "reasoning": "The stock has delivered a respectable weekly return of 1.5%, outperforming some peers, and has a relatively stable performance. However, the fundamentals suggest a mix of strengths and weaknesses, with concerns around high debt levels. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Given the moderate volatility and Sharpe Ratio, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's performance is decent but not exceptional."
