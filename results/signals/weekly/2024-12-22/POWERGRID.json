  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -1.36,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative returns make it a cautious investment opportunity. However, the company's financial health is strong, with a strong valuation and efficient operations. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. Given the mixed signals, a hold decision is recommended to wait for further clarity on the company's growth and debt concerns."
