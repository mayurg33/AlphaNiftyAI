  "sharpe_ratio": -2.89,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed its peers with a -7.37% return, and its Sharpe Ratio indicates poor risk-adjusted performance. The company's financial health is fragile, with high debt levels and a rich valuation. Additionally, the news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the historical context suggests that the impact of the news may be limited, making it a sell decision."
