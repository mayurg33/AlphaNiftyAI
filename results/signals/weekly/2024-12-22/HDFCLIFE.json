  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.75,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong market capitalization and decent profitability suggest financial stability. The neutral to positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also provide some comfort. Nevertheless, the high valuation and negative revenue growth are areas of concern, leading me to recommend a HOLD decision."
