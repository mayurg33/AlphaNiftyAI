  "sharpe_ratio": -0.73,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong growth trajectory, respectable profitability metrics, and positive news sentiment are positives. The valuation seems to be on the higher side, and the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. Overall, the stock is moderately risky, and I would hold it for now, waiting for a better entry point or further clarification on the valuation and debt position."
