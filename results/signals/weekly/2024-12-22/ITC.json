  "reasoning": "ITC's financial health is robust, with strong profitability metrics and decent growth. However, the valuation is slightly high, and the news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative due to the demerger of its hotels business. Given the contained risk profile and moderate risk-adjusted performance, I recommend a HOLD decision."
