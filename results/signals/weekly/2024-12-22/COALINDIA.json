  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 10.17,
  "sharpe_ratio": -2.78,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high max drawdown indicate high risk. However, its low P/E ratio and high dividend yield suggest undervaluation. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment further support a hold decision, as the stock's growth prospects and debt position are concerns."
