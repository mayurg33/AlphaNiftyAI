  "reasoning": "Wipro's stock performance was lackluster this week, with a negative return and high volatility. However, its fundamentals appear strong, with high profitability and reasonable valuation. The news sentiment is positive due to the recent acquisition, which could lead to future growth. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's strengths are balanced by its weaknesses and market risks."
