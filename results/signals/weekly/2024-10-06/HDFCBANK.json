  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 17.64,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.30,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest that it may be a good long-term investment. However, the lack of debt-to-equity ratio data and underperformance compared to peers are cautionary signs. In the current macroeconomic environment, the banking sector appears to be stable, with SCBs showing high RoA/RoE and low GNPA. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with a moderate confidence level."
