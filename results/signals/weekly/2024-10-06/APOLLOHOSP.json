  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 22.43,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.45,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe Ratio) make it a risky investment. However, the company's financial health is good, with strengths in earnings growth and decent revenue growth. The high valuation and debt levels are concerns, but the news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with caution."
