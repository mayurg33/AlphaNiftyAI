  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 10.56,
  "sharpe_ratio": -2.04,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance is disappointing, and the high volatility and negative Sharpe ratio indicate a high level of risk. However, the company's fundamentals are strong, with high gross margins and EBITDA margins, and promising revenue and earnings growth rates. The high valuation and debt levels are concerns, but the news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, pending further evaluation of the company's ability to manage its debt and valuation."
