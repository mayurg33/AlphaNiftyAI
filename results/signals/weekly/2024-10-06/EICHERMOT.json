  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was dismal, with a return of -6.36%, and its volatility was relatively high, indicating a risky investment environment. Furthermore, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, and its debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The negative news sentiment and decline in auto sector stocks also suggest a sell decision."
