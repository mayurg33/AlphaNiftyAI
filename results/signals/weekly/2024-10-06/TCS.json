  "sharpe_ratio": -0.12,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent underperformance and moderate level of risk indicated by the Sharpe Ratio suggest caution. However, the company's strong financial health, high gross margins, and profit margins are positives. The neutral to slightly positive news sentiment and upcoming Q2 results announcement also provide some optimism. Overall, a hold decision is warranted until the Q2 results provide more clarity on the stock's direction."
