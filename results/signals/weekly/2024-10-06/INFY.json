  "reasoning": "The stock has a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation, but its growth metrics are a concern. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the services sector, which Infosys operates in. However, the high volatility and moderate risk profile suggest a hold decision for now."
