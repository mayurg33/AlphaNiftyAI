  "sharpe_ratio": -1.05,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong growth trajectory, respectable profitability metrics, and decent macroeconomic environment support its fundamentals. The high valuation and debt-to-equity ratio are weaknesses, but not enough to warrant a sell. A hold decision is recommended to monitor the stock's performance and adjust as needed."
