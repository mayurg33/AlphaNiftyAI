  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 10.8,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.97,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong financial stability and high dividend yield are positives. The recent order from Power Grid is a positive news event, but the company's growth and debt concerns need to be addressed. Overall, the stock is relatively risky, and I would recommend holding for now, awaiting further developments."
