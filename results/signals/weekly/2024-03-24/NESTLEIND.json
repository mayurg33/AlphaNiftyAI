  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 36.66,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.02,
  "reasoning": "The stock's volatility is high, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns do not justify the risk. Although the company's financial health appears strong, the valuation is relatively high, and earnings growth is negative. The news sentiment is mixed, and the macroeconomic environment is stable, but not exceptionally strong. Therefore, I would hold the stock for now, rather than buying or selling."
