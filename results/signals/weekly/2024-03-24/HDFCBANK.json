  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.05,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong financial health, stable growth trajectory, and lack of debt are positives. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, but the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a strong services sector and improving rural consumption. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock and recommend a hold."
