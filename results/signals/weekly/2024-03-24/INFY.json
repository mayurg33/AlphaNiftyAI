  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 23.59,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.00,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest that it's not a sell. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, but the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with a growing services sector and stable interest rates. Therefore, I'm holding the stock for now, waiting for a clearer direction."
