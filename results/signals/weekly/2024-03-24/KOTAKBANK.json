  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,

  "sharpe_ratio": 1.86,
  "reasoning": "Kotak Mahindra Bank's strong weekly performance, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio indicate a high risk-adjusted return. The company's financial health, reflected in its high ROE and profit margins, supports a buy decision. Although growth metrics are a concern, the reasonable valuation and low debt burden mitigate this risk. The positive macroeconomic environment, with strong agriculture and services sectors, also supports a buy decision."
