  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 25.83,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.11,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high level of risk. However, the company's strong profitability and revenue growth suggest a positive trend. The neutral news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment also support a hold decision. Overall, the stock's valuation and debt position are concerns, but the company's financial health is stable, making it a hold for now."
