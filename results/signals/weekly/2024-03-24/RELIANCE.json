  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 15.04,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.29,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate risk profile and relatively low volatility suggest a hold decision. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.29 indicates that the return is somewhat justified by the risk-taking. Additionally, the positive news sentiment and strong market capitalization of Reliance Industries support a hold decision. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and slow revenue growth are concerns that prevent a buy decision."
