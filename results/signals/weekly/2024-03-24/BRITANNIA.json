  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 30.38,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.30,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment environment. Although the company's financial health is strong, the valuation metrics suggest it may be overpriced. The news sentiment is negative, which could further impact the stock's performance. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the risks outweigh the potential benefits."
