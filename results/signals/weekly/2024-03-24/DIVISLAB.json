  "volatility": 18.67,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.45,
  "reasoning": "The stock's financial health is robust, with high profit margins and a low debt-to-equity ratio. However, its valuation is relatively expensive, which may deter investors. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a strong services sector and growing private consumption. Given the stock's underperformance compared to SUNPHARMA, I would hold the stock for now and monitor its performance."
