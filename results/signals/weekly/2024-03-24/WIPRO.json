  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 33.14,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.54,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, but its fundamentals are strong, with a high gross margin and profit margin. The news sentiment is positive, with a focus on growth and expansion. However, the valuation seems stretched, and the debt-to-equity ratio could be improved. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision for now."
