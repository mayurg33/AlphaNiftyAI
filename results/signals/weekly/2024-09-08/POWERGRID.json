  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 1.81,
  "sharpe_ratio": -3.77,
  "reasoning": "The stock's financial health is stable, with strong gross margins and decent profit margins. However, the revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, and the debt-to-equity ratio is high. The valuation seems reasonable, but the Sharpe Ratio indicates high risk. Given the neutral news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment, I recommend a HOLD decision."
