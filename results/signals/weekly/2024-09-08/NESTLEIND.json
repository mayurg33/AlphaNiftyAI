  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 13.25,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock's volatility is high, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating a high-risk investment. However, the company's strong brand presence, high gross margins, and low debt-to-equity ratio are positives. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, but the macroeconomic environment suggests a stable growth outlook. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and benefits seem to be balanced."
