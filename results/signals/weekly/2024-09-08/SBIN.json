  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -4.82%, and its volatility was exceptionally high. The news sentiment is also negative, with Goldman Sachs expressing a negative view on SBI. Although the company's valuation is attractive, its growth prospects are weak, and the debt-to-equity ratio is not available, which is a concern. Overall, the risk-adjusted performance is poor, and the stock is a high-risk, underperforming stock."
