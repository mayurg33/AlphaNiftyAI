  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 11.76,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.75,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, negative news sentiment, and high volatility indicate a potential decline in stock price. Although the company's fundamentals are strong, the sluggish revenue and earnings growth rates are a concern. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, while generally positive, does not provide a strong catalyst for the stock's growth. Therefore, I recommend a SELL decision."
