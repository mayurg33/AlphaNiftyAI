  "volatility": 24.05,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.86,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong fundamentals, including high profit margins and low debt-to-equity ratio, suggest a solid underlying business. The rich valuation is a drawback, but the macroeconomic environment appears supportive, with a growing services sector and low unemployment. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, waiting for a better entry point or a correction in valuation."
