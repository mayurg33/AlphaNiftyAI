  "reasoning": "ITC's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest it's not a sell. However, the low revenue growth rate is a concern and needs to be monitored. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing, which could support ITC's future growth."
