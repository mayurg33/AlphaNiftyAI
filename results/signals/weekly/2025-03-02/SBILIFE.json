  "sharpe_ratio": -0.98,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns and moderate volatility suggest caution. Although the company's fundamentals appear strong, the revenue and earnings growth rates are concerning. The news sentiment is neutral, but the historical impact of dividend declarations on the stock price is negative. In this scenario, it's best to hold the stock and monitor its performance closely."
