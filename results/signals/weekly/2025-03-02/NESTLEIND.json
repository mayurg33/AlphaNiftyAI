  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 47.48,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.14,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Although it outperformed its peers, the max drawdown of -3.89% suggests a significant decline in value. The company's financial health is strong, but the high valuation and declining earnings growth are concerns. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision."
