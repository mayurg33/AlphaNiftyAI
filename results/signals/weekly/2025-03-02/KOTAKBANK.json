  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.92,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and moderate volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong profitability and reasonable valuation are positives. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a growing services sector and low unemployment. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
