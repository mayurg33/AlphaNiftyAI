  "sharpe_ratio": -1.09,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed its peers with a weekly return of -5.23% and high volatility. The negative news sentiment and bearish outlook towards the IT sector, particularly for TCS, suggest a downward trend. Additionally, the company's growth metrics are a concern, which may impact its future performance. Therefore, it's a good time to sell the stock."
