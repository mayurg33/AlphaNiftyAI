  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 15.14,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.33,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is strong, with high gross margins and ROE, and a reasonable valuation. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low, which is a concern. The news sentiment is mixed, with both positive and negative developments. Given the moderate volatility and Sharpe ratio, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential for future growth is uncertain."
