  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 24.28,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.23,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate high risk without adequate returns. Although the company has strong brand presence and profitability, its high P/E ratio and debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The neutral news sentiment and macroeconomic environment do not provide a strong catalyst for a buy or sell decision, hence a hold recommendation."
