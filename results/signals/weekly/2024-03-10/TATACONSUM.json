  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": 0.88,
  "reasoning": "The stock has delivered a strong weekly return, and its fundamentals appear healthy with revenue and earnings growth. However, the valuation is on the higher side, and the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of consumer spending. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
