  "sharpe_ratio": -0.32,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, and its volatility is moderate. Although the company has a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation, its growth metrics are a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, and the macroeconomic environment is mixed. Given these factors, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and weaknesses outweigh its strengths."
