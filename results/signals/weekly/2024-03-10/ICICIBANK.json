  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 13.7,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a riskier investment environment. Additionally, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E of 20.01 and a forward P/E of 37.54, suggesting that the stock may be overvalued. Although the company's fundamentals appear strong, the lack of debt information and high valuation outweigh the positives, leading to a SELL decision."
