  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.52,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong fundamentals, including profitability and growth, suggest a stable growth trajectory. The neutral news sentiment and macroeconomic environment also do not indicate a strong buy or sell signal. Therefore, I recommend a hold decision, awaiting further developments to reassess the stock's potential."
