  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance and high valuation (P/E of 70.13) are concerns, but its decent ROE and earnings growth are positives. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the industry. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and mixed impact of capex announcements on the stock price make me cautious, leading to a hold decision."
