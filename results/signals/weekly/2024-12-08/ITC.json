  "reasoning": "ITC's financial health is strong, with high profitability and reasonable valuation. However, the proposed increase in GST on cigarettes and other tobacco products has negatively impacted the stock, leading to a negative news sentiment. Additionally, the revenue growth rate is relatively low, which could be a concern. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
