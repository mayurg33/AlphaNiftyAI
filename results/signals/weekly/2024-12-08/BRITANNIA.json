  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.27,
  "reasoning": "Britannia's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profitability profile and attractive dividend yield are positives. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and stretched valuation are red flags. With a neutral news sentiment and a supportive macroeconomic environment, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with caution and close monitoring of the company's debt situation and valuation."
