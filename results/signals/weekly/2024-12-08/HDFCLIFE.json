  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the negative news sentiment surrounding the data breach and stretched valuation with high P/E ratios further support a sell decision. The company's financial stability and decent ROE are not enough to outweigh the current risks and concerns."
