  "sharpe_ratio": -1.15,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health and profitability profile are strong, with reasonable valuation and attractive dividend yield. However, its revenue growth rate is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with growth in services and manufacturing sectors, and low unemployment. Considering the stock's underperformance this week and moderate volatility, I recommend a HOLD decision."
