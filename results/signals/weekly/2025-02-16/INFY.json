  "sharpe_ratio": -0.41,
  "reasoning": "The stock's lackluster weekly performance and poor risk-adjusted returns suggest caution. However, the company's financial health, with a high gross margin and decent dividend yield, provides some stability. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment further support a hold decision, as the stock's growth potential is uncertain."
