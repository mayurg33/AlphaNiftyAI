  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 17.86,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.40,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong brand presence, high gross margins, and decent profit margins are positives. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of consumer defensive stocks. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with caution due to the high valuation and debt position."
