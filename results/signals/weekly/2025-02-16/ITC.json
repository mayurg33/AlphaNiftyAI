  "reasoning": "ITC's financial health is strong, with high profitability and a reasonable valuation. However, its revenue growth is slow, and the debt-to-equity ratio is moderate. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment support the stock, but the high volatility and poor weekly performance make me cautious, leading to a hold decision."
