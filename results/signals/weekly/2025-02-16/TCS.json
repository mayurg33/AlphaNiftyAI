  "sharpe_ratio": -0.61,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance has been lackluster, with a decline of 2.53% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.61, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's financial health is strong, with high ROE, EBITDA margins, and gross margins. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and low unemployment. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's strong fundamentals and positive news sentiment may help it recover from its recent decline."
