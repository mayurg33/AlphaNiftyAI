  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong financial health and robust growth rates are positives. However, the rich valuation and negative news sentiment due to the US Biosecure Act uncertainty are weighing on the stock. Given the mixed signals, a HOLD decision is warranted, with a moderate confidence level."
