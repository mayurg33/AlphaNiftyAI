  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 15.53,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.01,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest caution. However, the company's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation are positives. The positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also indicate potential upside. Overall, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and opportunities are balanced."
