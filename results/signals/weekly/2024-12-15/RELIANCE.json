  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 13.63,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.50,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing with a negative return and Sharpe Ratio, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's financial health is good, with strong gross margins, EBITDA margins, and ROE. The news sentiment is mixed, but slightly negative due to the stock's decline for five straight sessions. Given the neutral macroeconomic environment and the company's strengths, I would recommend a HOLD decision."
