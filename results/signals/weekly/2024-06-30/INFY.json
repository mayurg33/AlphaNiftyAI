  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 18.19,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.56,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly performance and decent Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively good risk-adjusted return. However, its high volatility and moderate level of risk suggest caution. Fundamentally, Infosys has a strong profitability profile, but its growth metrics are a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the macroeconomic environment is generally favorable, with a growing services sector and low inflation. Overall, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's pros and cons seem to balance out."
