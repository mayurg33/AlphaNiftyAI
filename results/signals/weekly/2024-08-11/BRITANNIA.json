  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance is decent, but high volatility and moderate risk suggest caution. Fundamentals are strong, but valuation is rich, and earnings growth is slow. Neutral news sentiment and a supportive macroeconomic environment don't provide a clear buy or sell signal, so it's best to hold for now."
