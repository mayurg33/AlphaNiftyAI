  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 7.48,
  "sharpe_ratio": 2.06,
  "reasoning": "CIPLA's strong weekly performance, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio indicate a low-risk, high-return stock. The company's financial health, profitability, and growth rates are also respectable. Although the valuation is on the higher side and debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, the overall fundamentals are strong. The neutral news sentiment and positive macroeconomic environment further support a buy decision."
