  "reasoning": "Wipro's weekly performance was decent, but its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment. The company's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risk-adjusted return is decent, but not exceptional."
