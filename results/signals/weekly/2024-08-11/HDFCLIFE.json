  "sharpe_ratio": -0.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock underperformed its peers with a weekly return of -1.2%, indicating poor performance. The high volatility of 50.59% and negative Sharpe Ratio of -0.08 suggest a risky investment. Additionally, the negative news sentiment and high valuation with a high trailing and forward P/E ratio further support a sell decision."
