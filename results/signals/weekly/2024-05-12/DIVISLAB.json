  "sharpe_ratio": -0.60,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong financial health, with high profitability metrics and low debt, is a positive. The stretched valuation is a red flag, but the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, awaiting a correction or a more favorable entry point."
