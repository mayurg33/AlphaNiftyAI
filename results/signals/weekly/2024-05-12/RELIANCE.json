  "volatility": 23.91,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.14,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly return of -0.85% is a concern, but its relatively low volatility and moderate Sharpe Ratio suggest a stable performance. Fundamentally, the company is financially healthy with strong margins and profitability, but its growth rates are a concern. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, with a rebound in Sensex and Nifty, support a hold decision."
