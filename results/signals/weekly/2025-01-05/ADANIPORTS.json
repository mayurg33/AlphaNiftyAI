  "sharpe_ratio": -0.26,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance this week and moderate volatility are concerns. However, the company's financial health is robust, with high EBITDA margins and growth prospects. The high debt-to-equity ratio and valuation are major concerns, but the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. Therefore, I recommend a hold decision, awaiting further developments to reassess the stock's potential."
