  "volatility": 12.64,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.57,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and low Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, its relatively low volatility and max drawdown compared to peers are positives. The news sentiment is positive, driven by the significant development of selling its Japanese arm, but the fundamentals are mixed with high gross margins and profit margins, but low return on equity and declining earnings growth. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, and a hold decision seems appropriate."
