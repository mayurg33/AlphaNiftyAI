  "reasoning": "Although TCS has a disappointing week with high volatility, its fundamentals are strong with high gross margins and profit margins. The news sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, which could boost the stock's performance. However, the revenue and earnings growth rates are sluggish, and the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, making it a hold decision."
