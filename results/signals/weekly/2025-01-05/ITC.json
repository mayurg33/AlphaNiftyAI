  "reasoning": "ITC's mediocre performance, high volatility, and unimpressive Sharpe Ratio suggest a cautious approach. While the company's financial health is strong, its revenue growth is sluggish, and debt management is a concern. The negative news sentiment and demerger of hotels business may impact the stock price in the short term. However, the macroeconomic environment is supportive of consumer spending and rural consumption, which could benefit ITC in the long run."
