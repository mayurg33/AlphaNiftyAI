  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 18.19,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.50,
  "reasoning": "ICICIBANK's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profit margin and ROE suggest underlying financial health. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, including a growing services sector and low unemployment, support the stock. However, the high valuation and lack of debt information are weaknesses that prevent a BUY recommendation. A HOLD decision is warranted until the stock's valuation improves or more information becomes available."
