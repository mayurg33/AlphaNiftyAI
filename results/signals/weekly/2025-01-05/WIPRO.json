  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is positive, with strong profitability and reasonable valuation. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors. Given the stock's poor weekly performance and moderate volatility, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further improvement in the company's debt management and market sentiment."
