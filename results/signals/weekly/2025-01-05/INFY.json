  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment environment. However, Infosys' strong profitability and low debt levels are strengths. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a growing services sector and low unemployment. But the company's slow growth metrics are a concern, making it a HOLD decision."
