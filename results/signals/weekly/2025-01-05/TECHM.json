  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.44,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a negative return and Sharpe Ratio. However, the company's fundamentals are strong, with high ROE and EBITDA margins, and a reasonable valuation. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarity on the company's quarterly results and market reaction."
