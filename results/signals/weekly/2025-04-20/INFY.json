  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 15.24,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.24,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, and the news sentiment is negative, which could lead to a short-term decline. However, the company's fundamentals are strong, with a high gross margin and profit margin, and a reasonable valuation. Considering the macroeconomic environment, the services sector is growing, and private consumption is up, which could support the company's growth in the long run. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision."
