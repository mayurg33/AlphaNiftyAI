  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. However, the revenue growth rate is relatively low, and the cautious guidance for Q1FY26 has led to a negative sentiment. Given the mixed bag of positive and negative news events, I would hold the stock for now and monitor its performance closely."
