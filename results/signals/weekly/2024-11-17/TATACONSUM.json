  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a significant decline in value and a high volatility. The Sharpe Ratio is also negative, indicating that the returns were not justified by the level of risk taken. Furthermore, the company's valuation seems to be on the higher side, with a trailing P/E of 84.62 and forward P/E of 74.14, which may not be sustainable in the long run."
