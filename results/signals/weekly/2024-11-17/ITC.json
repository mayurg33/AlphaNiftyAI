  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 9.49,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.29,
  "reasoning": "ITC's poor weekly performance and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, its strong profitability profile, attractive dividend yield, and relatively low volatility suggest that it's a stable stock. The neutral to positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment also support a HOLD decision. But, the high valuation and moderate growth rates are concerns that prevent a BUY recommendation."
