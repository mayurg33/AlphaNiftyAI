  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 4.06,
  "sharpe_ratio": -2.89,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns and lack of upside potential make it an unattractive investment option. However, the company's financial health is good, with high gross margins and EBITDA margins. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive, but the stock's high valuation and moderate debt position are concerns. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision."
