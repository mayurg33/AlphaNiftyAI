  "reasoning": "The stock's dismal weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. Additionally, the company's Q2 results were disappointing, and the valuation seems to be on the higher side. With a negative news sentiment and growth prospects being a concern, it's a good time to sell the stock."
