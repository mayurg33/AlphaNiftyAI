  "sharpe_ratio": -0.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance is lackluster, and its volatility is high, indicating significant price fluctuations. However, the company's financial health is good, with strong gross margins and EBITDA margins. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, suggesting a potential recovery from its recent decline. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarity on the company's growth and debt concerns."
