  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.75,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns suggest caution. However, the company's strong fundamentals, including profitability and growth, are offset by concerns over debt position and valuation. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. Therefore, I recommend a hold decision, awaiting further clarity on the company's ability to address its weaknesses."
