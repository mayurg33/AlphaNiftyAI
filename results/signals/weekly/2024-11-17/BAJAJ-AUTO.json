  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 24.84,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.95,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the company's negative earnings growth and rich valuation are concerns. Although the company's financial health is good, the current news sentiment is Neutral to Slightly Negative, and the macroeconomic environment is not particularly supportive of the automotive industry. Therefore, it's a good time to sell the stock."
