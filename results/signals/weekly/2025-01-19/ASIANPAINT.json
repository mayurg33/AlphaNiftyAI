  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 20.67,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a moderate level of risk without impressive returns. The company's financial health is good, but growth concerns and high valuation may impact its future performance. The negative news sentiment and bearish market tone also suggest a sell decision."
