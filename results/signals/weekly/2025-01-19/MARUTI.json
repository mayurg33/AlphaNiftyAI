  "decision": "BUY",

  "volatility": 12.1,
  "sharpe_ratio": 1.79,
  "reasoning": "Maruti's strong weekly performance, with a 5.55% return and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.79, indicates a robust risk-adjusted return. The company's financial health is strong, with high gross margins, low debt-to-equity ratio, and reasonable valuation. The neutral to positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, with growing agriculture and services sectors, support the buy decision."
