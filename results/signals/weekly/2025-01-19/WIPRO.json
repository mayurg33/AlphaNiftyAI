  "reasoning": "Wipro's strong Q3 results, beating estimates, and attractive dividend yield are positives. The company's profitability profile and reasonable valuation also support a buy decision. Although revenue growth is a concern, the overall news sentiment is positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. With a moderate risk profile, I'm confident in a buy decision."
