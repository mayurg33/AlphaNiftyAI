  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 23.17,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "The stock's decent weekly return and positive news sentiment are encouraging, but its mixed financial health, high debt-to-equity ratio, and low profit margins are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is generally supportive, with a positive outlook for the automotive industry. However, the stock's high volatility and moderate risk-adjusted return suggest a cautious approach, leading me to recommend a HOLD decision."
