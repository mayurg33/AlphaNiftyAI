  "volatility": 60.37,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly return of 1.04% outperformed its peers, and its Sharpe Ratio of 0.08 indicates a better risk-adjusted performance. However, the high volatility of 60.37% and high debt-to-equity ratio of 315.41 are concerns. The company's financial health is strong, but it needs to address its high debt levels and stagnant revenue growth. Given the positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, I'm inclined to hold the stock for now."
