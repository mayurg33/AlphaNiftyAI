  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 27.68,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.57,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the company's sluggish revenue and earnings growth, combined with a premium valuation, make it an unattractive option. The mixed news sentiment and neutral macroeconomic environment further support a sell decision."
