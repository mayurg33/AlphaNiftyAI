  "sharpe_ratio": -0.34,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, but its fundamentals are strong, with a high gross margin and profit margin. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and low inflation. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
