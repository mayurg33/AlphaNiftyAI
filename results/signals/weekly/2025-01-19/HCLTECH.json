  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 68.6,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.59,
  "reasoning": "The stock's dismal weekly performance, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) suggest a strong sell signal. Additionally, the negative news sentiment and disappointing Q3 results further support this decision. Although the company's fundamentals appear strong, the growth metrics are a concern, and the high debt-to-equity ratio is a weakness."
