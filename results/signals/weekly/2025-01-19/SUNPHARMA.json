  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 16.12,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.56,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively stable investment. However, the mixed financial health, with strengths in margins and dividend yield but weaknesses in profitability and debt position, prevents a strong buy recommendation. The neutral news sentiment and macroeconomic environment also support a hold decision."
