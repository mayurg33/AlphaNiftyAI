  "sharpe_ratio": -0.05,
  "reasoning": "Although Wipro's financial health is strong with high gross margins and decent profit margins, its high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The company's Q1 results were a mixed bag, with revenue missing estimates, leading to a decline in shares. The negative news sentiment and high volatility make it a risky investment, but the reasonable forward P/E ratio and high earnings growth rate suggest potential for future growth. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision."
