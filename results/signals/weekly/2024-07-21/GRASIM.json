  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 21.84,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.52,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong fundamentals, such as high gross margins and EBITDA margins, suggest a profitable business model. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, including a strong monsoon and easing CPI inflation, may support the stock's growth. Nevertheless, the stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio warrant caution, leading to a hold decision."
