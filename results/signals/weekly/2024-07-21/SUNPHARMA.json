  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns, high debt-to-equity ratio, and stretched valuation are major concerns. The negative news sentiment and historical impact of similar news on the stock price also suggest a downward trend. Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment, although positive, may not be enough to offset the company's internal issues."
