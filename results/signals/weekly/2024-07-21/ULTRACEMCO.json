  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 25.82,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.01,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. The company's high valuation and debt levels are concerns, despite its strong financial health. The negative news sentiment and expected weak Q1 performance further support a sell decision."
