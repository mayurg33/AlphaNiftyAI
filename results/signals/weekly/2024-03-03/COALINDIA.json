  "sharpe_ratio": 0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's modest weekly performance and high volatility suggest a moderate risk profile. While the company's financial health is stable, it requires improvement in growth and debt management. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment do not provide a strong buy or sell signal, leading me to recommend a hold decision."
