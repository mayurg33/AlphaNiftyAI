  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 27.66,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.40,
  "reasoning": "Hindalco's strong weekly performance, decent risk-adjusted return, and attractive valuation with a low P/E ratio of 9.31 support a buy decision. The company's revenue and earnings growth are notable, and the macroeconomic environment is favorable, with a strong services sector and improving rural consumption. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, which reduces my confidence level."
