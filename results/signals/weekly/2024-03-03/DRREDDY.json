  "sharpe_ratio": -0.55,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong profitability profile and attractive valuation suggest potential upside. The high debt-to-equity ratio is a weakness, but the macroeconomic environment is generally supportive. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, waiting for a clearer trend to emerge."
