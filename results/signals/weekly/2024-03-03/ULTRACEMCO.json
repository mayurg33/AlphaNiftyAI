  "volatility": 25.83,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.32,
  "reasoning": "The stock's volatility is relatively contained, and its Sharpe Ratio suggests a low risk-adjusted return. However, the company's financial health is strong, with high profitability metrics and a respectable ROE. The valuation seems stretched, which is a concern. Given the neutral news sentiment and the macroeconomic environment supporting rural consumption and services sector growth, I would hold the stock for now, but with a cautious outlook."
