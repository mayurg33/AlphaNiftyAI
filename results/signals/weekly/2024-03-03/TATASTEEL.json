  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 59.27,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.35,
  "reasoning": "The stock has a strong weekly performance, but high volatility and a relatively low Sharpe Ratio indicate a riskier investment. Fundamentally, the company's financial health is a concern due to high debt-to-equity ratio, despite some attractive metrics. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but historical similar news suggests volatility in stock prices. Given the mixed bag of fundamentals and uncertain market reaction, I would recommend a HOLD decision."
