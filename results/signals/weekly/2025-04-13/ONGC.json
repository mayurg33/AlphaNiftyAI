  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 51.01,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.50,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and max drawdown of -2.08% make it a relatively risky bet. However, its low trailing and forward P/E ratios suggest it is undervalued, and its high dividend yield of 6.96% is attractive. The company's financial health is stable, but it needs to address its growth and debt issues. Given the neutral news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment, I recommend a HOLD decision."
