  "reasoning": "Maruti's moderate weekly return and relatively low volatility indicate a stable investment option. The company's strong operational efficiency, low debt, and reasonable valuation are positives. However, slow revenue and earnings growth rates are concerns. Given the neutral macroeconomic environment and lack of specific news, a hold decision is recommended."
