  "reasoning": "Wipro's weekly performance was disappointing, but its fundamentals appear strong with high profitability and reasonable valuation. However, the revenue growth rate is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and stable inflation. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarification on the company's growth prospects."
