  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and relatively low Sharpe Ratio suggest a cautious approach. While the company's financial health is strong, its high valuation and debt position are concerns. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but not strong enough to outweigh the concerns. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision."
