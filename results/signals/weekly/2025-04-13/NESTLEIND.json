  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 19.71,
  "sharpe_ratio": 1.32,
  "reasoning": "Nestle India's strong weekly performance and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively attractive return given the level of risk. However, the high valuation and declining earnings growth are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a strong services sector and growing private consumption. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
