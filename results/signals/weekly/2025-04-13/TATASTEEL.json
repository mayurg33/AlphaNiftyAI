  "volatility": 58.13,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.29,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio suggest a risky investment. Although the news sentiment is positive, the company's financial health is mixed, with high debt levels and negative revenue growth. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, but not strong enough to outweigh the company's weaknesses. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's performance is mediocre and the risks outweigh the potential benefits."
