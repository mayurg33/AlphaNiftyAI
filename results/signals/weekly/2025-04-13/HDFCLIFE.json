  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively risky investment. Additionally, the company's valuation seems to be stretched with a high trailing and forward P/E ratio, suggesting it may be overpriced. Furthermore, the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which could be a concern. Overall, the stock's lackluster performance and high volatility make it a relatively risky investment, leading me to recommend a SELL."
