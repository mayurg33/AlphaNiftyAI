  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 29.01,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's high valuation and debt levels are concerning. The negative news sentiment, driven by disappointing Q2 earnings results, further supports a sell decision."
