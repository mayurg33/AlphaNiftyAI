  "sharpe_ratio": -1.00,
  "reasoning": "The stock has a dismal week with a -5.0% return, underperforming its peers. The company's revenue and earnings growth rates are negative, indicating a slowdown in recent performance. Additionally, the high valuation with a trailing P/E ratio of 59.47 and a forward P/E ratio of 80.57 suggests that the stock may be overvalued. The negative news sentiment and bleak Q2 preview further support a sell decision."
