  "sharpe_ratio": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly return is modest, and the Sharpe Ratio indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. While the news sentiment is positive due to the strong Q2 results, the company's financial health is fragile with high debt levels and uncertain growth prospects. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, but the stock's volatility is high, making it a HOLD decision."
