  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 24.09,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.01,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns, high volatility, and max drawdown indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the company's stretched valuation, high debt-to-equity ratio, and negative earnings growth are concerning. The recent US court ruling has also negatively impacted the stock's price, further supporting a sell decision."
