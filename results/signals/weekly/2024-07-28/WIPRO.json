  "reasoning": "Wipro's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. However, its high volatility and moderate Sharpe Ratio indicate a cautious approach. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a strong services sector and growing private consumption. Nevertheless, Wipro's slow revenue growth rate is a concern, making a HOLD decision more suitable than a BUY."
