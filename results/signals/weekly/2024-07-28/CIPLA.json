  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly performance and positive news sentiment, driven by its Q1 results and expansion plans, suggest a BUY decision. The company's financial health is positive, with strong profitability metrics and growth trajectory. Although the valuation is slightly stretched and debt levels are moderate, the overall positive tone and analyst recommendations outweigh these concerns."
