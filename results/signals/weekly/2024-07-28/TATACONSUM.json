  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and relatively low Sharpe Ratio indicate a high level of risk. Additionally, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and overvalued stock price are concerns. The negative news sentiment and recent decline in share price due to the rights issue announcement further support a sell decision."
