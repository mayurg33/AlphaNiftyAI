  "sharpe_ratio": -0.18,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, and its volatility is moderate. Although the company has a strong profitability profile, its growth metrics are a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, and the macroeconomic environment is mixed. Given these factors, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and weaknesses outweigh its strengths."
