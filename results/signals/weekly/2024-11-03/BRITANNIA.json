  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the stock's underperformance compared to its peers and stretched valuation ratios (P/E ratio of 62.25 and 69.03) suggest that it may be overpriced. Although the company has a strong track record of profitability, its slow revenue and earnings growth are concerns. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock."
