  "reasoning": "Wipro's mediocre weekly performance and neutral to negative news sentiment suggest a hold decision. The company's financial health is stable, with a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation. However, sluggish revenue growth and underperformance compared to peers are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing, but the company needs to focus on accelerating its revenue growth to unlock its full potential."
