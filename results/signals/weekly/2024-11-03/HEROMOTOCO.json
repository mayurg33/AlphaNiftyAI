  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 37.45,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.21,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly performance and moderate risk-adjusted return are positives. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and mixed news sentiment are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is generally supportive, with a growing services sector and stable inflation. Overall, I recommend a hold decision, as the stock's strengths are balanced by its weaknesses, and further monitoring is needed to determine its future direction."
