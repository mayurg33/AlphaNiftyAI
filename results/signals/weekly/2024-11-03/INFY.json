  "sharpe_ratio": -1.21,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong profitability and reasonable valuation are positives. The macroeconomic environment is generally supportive, with a growing services sector and low inflation. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarity on the company's growth prospects."
