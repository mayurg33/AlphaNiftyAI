  "sharpe_ratio": -0.50,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a -2.07% return, and it underperformed its peers. The company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative revenue and earnings growth rates, and the valuation is relatively high. Although the company's profitability and debt position are strengths, the growth and valuation weaknesses outweigh them, making it a sell decision."
