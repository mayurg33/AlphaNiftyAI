  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 10.12,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.59,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and low Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's financial health is satisfactory, with a reasonable valuation and strong profitability. The news sentiment is neutral with a slight bias towards positivity, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's current decline may be a buying opportunity, but more analysis is needed to confirm."
