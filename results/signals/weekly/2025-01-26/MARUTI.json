  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 15.95,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.10,
  "reasoning": "Maruti's relatively resilient weekly return and lower volatility compared to peers are positives. However, the stock's Sharpe Ratio indicates a relatively risky investment. Fundamentally, the company's strong market capitalization, high gross margins, and respectable ROE are strengths, but sluggish revenue and earnings growth are concerns. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
