  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 14.12,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.36,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's strong profitability profile and moderate growth metrics are positives. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment also support the stock. Considering these mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
