  "volatility": 27.88,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.51,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly return of 3.57% is decent, and its Sharpe Ratio of 0.51 indicates moderate risk-adjusted returns. However, the high volatility and Max Drawdown of -0.93% suggest a relatively high risk profile. The company's financial health is stable, but the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision for now."
