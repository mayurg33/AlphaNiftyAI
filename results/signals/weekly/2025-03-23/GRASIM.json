  "reasoning": "The stock's decent return and moderate risk-adjusted return are positives, but its high volatility and stretched valuation are concerns. The positive news sentiment and buy recommendations from ICICI Securities are encouraging, but the high debt-to-equity ratio and mixed macroeconomic environment make me cautious. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock and recommend a hold."
