  "sharpe_ratio": -0.05,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative returns make it a cautious investment opportunity. However, its relatively low trailing P/E ratio and decent dividend yield suggest undervaluation. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the removal from the Nifty 50 index may have a negative impact on the stock price. Overall, it's a hold decision due to mixed signals."
