  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 22.26,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.71,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, its strong profitability profile and attractive valuation suggest potential undervaluation. The mixed news sentiment and macroeconomic environment do not provide a clear direction. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarification on the stock's prospects."
