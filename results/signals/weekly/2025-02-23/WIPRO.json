  "volatility": 29.49,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.05,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's decent financial health, with strong profit margins and efficient use of shareholders' equity, is offset by concerns over revenue growth and debt position. The negative news sentiment and high volatility also warrant caution. However, the stock appears undervalued with a forward P/E of 10.48, suggesting potential for long-term growth. Overall, a hold decision is recommended, pending improvement in revenue growth and debt position."
