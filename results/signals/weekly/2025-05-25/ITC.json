  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 26.65,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.04,
  "reasoning": "ITC's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential upside, but high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate significant risk. The neutral to slightly positive news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment support a hold decision, as the market digests recent news and awaits further developments."
