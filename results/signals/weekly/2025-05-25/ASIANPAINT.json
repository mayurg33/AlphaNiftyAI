  "sharpe_ratio": -0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment environment. The company's recent performance is declining, with negative revenue and earnings growth rates, and its valuation is relatively high. The news sentiment is also predominantly negative, citing muted demand and rising competition as the main reasons for the decline in profit and revenue."
