  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 24.66,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns indicate caution. However, the company's strong fundamentals, such as high gross margins and decent profit margins, suggest potential for long-term growth. The macroeconomic environment is also relatively stable, with moderate growth projections. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with a low confidence level due to the stock's recent underperformance."
