  "sharpe_ratio": -0.93,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.97%, underperforming its peers. The news sentiment is negative, with a decline in net profit and profitability due to high provisions, which historically has led to a decline in the stock price. Furthermore, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative revenue and earnings growth. Although the company's profitability profile is strong, the overall picture suggests a sell decision."
