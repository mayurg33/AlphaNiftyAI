  "volatility": 7.93,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance is disappointing, with a negative return and low Sharpe Ratio. However, its volatility is relatively low, and it outperformed MARUTI in terms of return. Fundamentally, the company has strengths in its high gross margins and return on equity, but growth concerns and high valuation are a concern. Given the neutral news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment, I recommend a HOLD decision."
