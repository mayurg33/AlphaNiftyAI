  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 11.43,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.21,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong fundamentals, such as high gross margins and EBITDA margins, suggest a profitable business model. The neutral news sentiment and lack of significant macroeconomic trends affecting the stock also support a hold decision. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and relatively high trailing P/E ratio are concerns that prevent a buy decision."
