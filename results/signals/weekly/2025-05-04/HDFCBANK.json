  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 11.75,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.04,
  "reasoning": "The stock's modest weekly return and high volatility indicate a moderate risk profile. Although the fundamentals are strong, the valuation looks slightly rich, which may limit upside potential. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the macroeconomic environment is stable, with a projected GDP growth rate of 3.4%. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's growth potential is uncertain."
