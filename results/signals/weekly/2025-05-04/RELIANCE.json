  "sharpe_ratio": 1.29,
  "reasoning": "The stock has delivered a strong weekly performance with a 3.73% return, but its high volatility and debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The company's financial health is good, but it needs to improve its growth prospects and debt management. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the macroeconomic environment is stable, which supports the HOLD decision."
