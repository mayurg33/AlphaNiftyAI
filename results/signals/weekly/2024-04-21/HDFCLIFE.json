  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 12.21,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.81,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing with a return of -1.86% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.81, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The company's valuation seems to be on the higher side with a trailing P/E of 91.05 and forward P/E of 121.98, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the negative revenue growth of -0.138 is a concern. Although the company's financial health is stable, the high valuation and negative revenue growth outweigh the positives, leading to a SELL decision."
