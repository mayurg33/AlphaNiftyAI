  "confidence": 6,

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.27,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong financial health and profitability metrics are positives. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a strong services sector and improving rural consumption. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
