  "reasoning": "ITC's weekly performance was disappointing with high volatility and poor returns. However, its fundamentals are strong, with a high profitability profile and decent dividend yield. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, but the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a strong monsoon forecast and easing inflation. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
