  "sharpe_ratio": -0.85,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong financial health and respectable profitability profile are positives. The news sentiment is overall positive, with the acquisition of Ivia Beaute's business being a strategic move. However, the macroeconomic environment is mixed, with some sectors showing strong growth while others are slowing down. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock and would hold for now."
