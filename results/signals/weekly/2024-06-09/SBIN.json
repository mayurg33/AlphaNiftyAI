  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 133.25,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.22,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong financial fundamentals, including low P/E ratios and respectable profit margins, suggest undervaluation. The mixed news sentiment and neutral macroeconomic environment do not provide a clear direction. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarification on the stock's growth prospects and debt position."
