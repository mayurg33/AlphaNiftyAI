  "reasoning": "Wipro's strong weekly performance and positive news sentiment driven by significant deal wins and AI advancements are encouraging. However, the high volatility and moderate risk-adjusted returns suggest caution. Additionally, the company's financial health is characterized by stability and moderate growth potential, but the low revenue growth rate is a concern. Overall, a HOLD decision is recommended, as the stock's potential is promising but requires closer monitoring of its volatility and revenue growth."
