  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 11.3,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.53,
  "reasoning": "CIPLA's poor risk-adjusted returns and moderate volatility suggest a cautious approach. Although the company's fundamentals are strong, its high valuation and debt concerns are drawbacks. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but not exceptionally strong. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and rewards are balanced."
