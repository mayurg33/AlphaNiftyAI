  "decision": "HOLD",

  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health appears stable with strong profitability and reasonable valuation. However, the revenue growth rate is sluggish, and the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which could be a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and improving employment numbers. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
