  "reasoning": "Maruti's poor weekly performance and moderate risk profile are concerns. However, its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest that the stock is not a sell. The macroeconomic environment is supportive of the automotive industry, with two-wheeler production and sales up significantly. Therefore, I recommend a hold decision, awaiting a potential rebound in the stock's performance."
