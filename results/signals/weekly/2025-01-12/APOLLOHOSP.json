  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility make it a risky investment. Although the company's fundamentals appear strong, the rich valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The neutral to positive news sentiment is not enough to outweigh the negative factors, leading me to recommend a sell decision."
