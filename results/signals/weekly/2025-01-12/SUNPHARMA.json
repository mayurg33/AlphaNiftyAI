  "sharpe_ratio": -0.79,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio suggest poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's declining earnings growth and high debt-to-equity ratio are major concerns. Although the company has strong profitability, the negatives outweigh the positives, leading me to recommend a SELL."
