  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 14.62,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.08,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns, high volatility, and notable decline in value indicate a relatively risky investment. Additionally, the company's high valuation and debt levels are areas of concern. Although the company has some strengths, such as strong gross margins and EBITDA margins, the overall picture suggests a SELL decision."
