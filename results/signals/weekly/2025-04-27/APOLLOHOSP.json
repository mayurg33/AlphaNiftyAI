  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 25.56,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.41,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong growth trajectory, decent profitability, and positive news sentiment are strengths. The stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are areas of concern. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further clarification on the company's ability to manage its debt and sustain its growth momentum."
