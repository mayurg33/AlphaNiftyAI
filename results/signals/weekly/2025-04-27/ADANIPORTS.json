  "sharpe_ratio": -0.58,
  "reasoning": "The stock underperformed its peers this week, with a weekly return of -4.03%. The high volatility of 27.71% contributed to its poor performance, resulting in a Sharpe Ratio of -0.58. Additionally, the company's valuation seems rich, with a trailing P/E of 27.06 and forward P/E of 41.58, suggesting potential overvaluation. The high debt-to-equity ratio of 79.19 also poses a risk to the company's financial stability."
