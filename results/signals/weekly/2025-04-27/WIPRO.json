  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is strong, with high gross margins and decent profit margins, but its revenue growth is sluggish. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E of 10.48, suggesting potential for upside. However, the high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively risky bet. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision."
