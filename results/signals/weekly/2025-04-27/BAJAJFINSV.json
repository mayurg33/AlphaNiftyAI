  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 27.57,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.39,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's financial health is strong, with high ROE and profit margins. The positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector and consumer behavior, suggest that the stock may rebound. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with caution due to the high volatility."
