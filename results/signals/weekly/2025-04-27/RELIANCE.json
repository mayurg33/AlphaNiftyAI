  "reasoning": "Reliance's modest weekly performance and relatively low volatility make it a safe bet. The company's strong financial health, decent ROE, and reasonable valuation support a buy decision. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and low unemployment, also contribute to a favorable outlook."
