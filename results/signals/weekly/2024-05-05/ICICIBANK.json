  "sharpe_ratio": -0.80,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility suggest a cautious approach. However, the company's strong profitability profile and moderate growth rates are positives. The neutral news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment also support a hold decision, as the stock's weaknesses may be offset by its strengths."
