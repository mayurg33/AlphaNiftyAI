  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 16.18,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.50,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate weekly return and decent Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively good risk-adjusted performance. The company's strong fundamentals, including high ROE and profit margins, suggest a promising future. The positive news sentiment, particularly the RBI's lifting of restrictions, is a significant positive development. Although the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, the overall outlook appears bullish, making it a buy recommendation."
