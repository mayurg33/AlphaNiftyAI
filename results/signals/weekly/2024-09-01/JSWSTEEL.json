  "sharpe_ratio": -0.50,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns suggest caution. However, the company's strong profitability profile and decent ROE are positives. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment further support a hold decision, as the stock's growth metrics are uncertain."
