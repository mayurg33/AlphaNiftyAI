  "reasoning": "NTPC's weekly performance was decent, but its high volatility and modest Sharpe Ratio warrant caution. The company's financial health is strong, but it needs to work on reducing its debt levels and improving its revenue growth. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the macroeconomic environment is stable, which supports the HOLD decision."
