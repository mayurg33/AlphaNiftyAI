  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's high valuation and debt position are concerns. The recent news of an income tax demand notice has a negative impact on the stock, and the macroeconomic environment, although positive, may not be enough to offset these negatives."
