  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 8.88,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.14,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and low Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's strong profitability metrics and positive news sentiment suggest potential for growth. The macroeconomic environment also appears supportive, with a growing services sector and increasing private consumption. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, awaiting further developments to make a more informed decision."
