  "sharpe_ratio": -0.69,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's financial health is fragile, with a high debt-to-equity ratio and negative revenue growth. Although the macroeconomic environment is supportive, the company's specific weaknesses outweigh the general positive trends."
