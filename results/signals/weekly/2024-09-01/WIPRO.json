  "reasoning": "Wipro's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. However, its high volatility and debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The neutral to slightly positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment support a hold decision, as the stock may trade in a relatively narrow range."
