  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": 0.27,
  "reasoning": "Axis Bank's decent risk-adjusted return and moderate volatility suggest a HOLD decision. The company's financial health is stable, but growth prospects appear limited. The neutral news sentiment and mixed historical context do not provide a strong bullish or bearish signal. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but its impact on the banking sector is unclear."
