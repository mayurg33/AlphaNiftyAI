  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 29.33,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.48,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate risk-adjusted return and decent dividend yield suggest a HOLD decision. However, the high volatility and negative revenue and earnings growth are concerns. The positive news sentiment and investment plan announcement are encouraging, but the company's financial health needs improvement. Overall, a HOLD decision is warranted, pending further improvement in the company's fundamentals."
