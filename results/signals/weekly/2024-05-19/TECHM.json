  "sharpe_ratio": 0.65,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate weekly performance and average Sharpe Ratio suggest a neutral stance. While the company's fundamentals are strong in terms of profitability and valuation, concerns around revenue growth and debt position need to be addressed. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, but the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. In the current macroeconomic environment, the Indian economy is showing signs of growth, but the global outlook is mixed, making it a HOLD decision."
