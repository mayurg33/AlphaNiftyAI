  "sharpe_ratio": 0.55,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's strong profitability profile, decent valuation, and high earnings growth rate suggest a solid investment opportunity. The company's recent performance has been strong, outperforming peers and exhibiting relatively low volatility. Although the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, the overall macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector, low inflation, and a stable interest rate environment, which should benefit Wipro's business."
