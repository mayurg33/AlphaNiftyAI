  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 25.4,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.04,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively riskier investment. However, the company's strong financial health, positive news sentiment, and macroeconomic environment supporting rural spending and services sector growth are positives. But, the high valuation and debt position are concerns, leading me to recommend a HOLD decision."
