  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 8.8,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.77,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly return is disappointing, and its Sharpe Ratio indicates poor risk-adjusted performance. However, the forward P/E ratio suggests the stock may be undervalued. Considering the mixed fundamentals and lack of specific news, I'm taking a neutral stance. The macroeconomic environment seems supportive, but I need more information to make a more confident decision."
