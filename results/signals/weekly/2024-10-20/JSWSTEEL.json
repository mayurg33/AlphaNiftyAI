  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.40,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's decent EBITDA margins and gross margins suggest some operational strength. The rich valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are significant concerns, but the neutral to mixed news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment suggest holding the stock for now."
