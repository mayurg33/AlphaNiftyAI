  "reasoning": "Wipro's mediocre weekly performance and high volatility make it a risky investment. However, its strong fundamentals, including high gross margins and decent profit margins, suggest a stable financial health. The positive news sentiment, driven by its strong Q2 results and bonus share issue, is a positive factor. Nevertheless, the sluggish revenue growth is a concern, and I would like to see improvement in this area before making a buy decision."
