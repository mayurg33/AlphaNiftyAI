  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high level of risk. The company's valuation seems stretched with high P/E ratios, and the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. Additionally, the news sentiment is negative, suggesting a potential decline in the stock price. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock."
