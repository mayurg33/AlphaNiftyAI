  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 18.0,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.40,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong growth trajectory, moderate profitability, and neutral to positive news sentiment suggest that the stock may rebound. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment is supportive of consumer spending, which could benefit the company. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with a moderate level of confidence."
