  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 22.74,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.09,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. However, the company's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. The negative news sentiment and high debt levels are concerns, but the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the automotive industry. Overall, it's a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and benefits are balanced."
