  "reasoning": "INFY's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation are positives, but its negative earnings growth and slow revenue growth are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a strong services sector and improving rural consumption. However, the stock's underperformance compared to its peers and moderate volatility suggest a hold decision."
