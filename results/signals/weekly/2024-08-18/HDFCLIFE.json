  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 25.78,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.38,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted return, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. Additionally, the company's stretched valuation with high P/E ratios and negative revenue growth are concerns. Although the macroeconomic environment is positive, the news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, further supporting a sell decision."
