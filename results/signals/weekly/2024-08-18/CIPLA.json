  "sharpe_ratio": -0.21,
  "reasoning": "Cipla's financial health and growth metrics are promising, but the stock's valuation is slightly high and debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors. However, the stock's recent performance has been disappointing, and the Sharpe ratio indicates a relatively risky investment. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision for now."
