  "sharpe_ratio": -0.78,
  "reasoning": "ICICIBANK's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, its strong profit margin and decent ROE suggest financial health. The high forward P/E ratio indicates overvaluation, but the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, awaiting a correction or further improvement in fundamentals."
