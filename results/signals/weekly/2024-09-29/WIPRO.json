  "reasoning": "Wipro's mediocre weekly performance and relatively high volatility are concerns. However, its strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation suggest potential for future growth. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a stable financial sector and growing services sector. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, awaiting improvement in revenue growth to sustain long-term profitability."
