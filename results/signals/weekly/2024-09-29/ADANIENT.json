  "sharpe_ratio": 1.10,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly return and favorable risk-return profile suggest a BUY decision. The positive news sentiment, driven by Adani Group's $4 billion investment in expanding its data centre business, is likely to boost investor confidence and drive the stock price up. Although the company's financial health is fragile, the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector, low inflation, and increasing private consumption. Overall, the potential upside outweighs the risks."
