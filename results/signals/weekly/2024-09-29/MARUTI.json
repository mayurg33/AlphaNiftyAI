  "reasoning": "Maruti's strong weekly return and relatively balanced risk-return profile are positives. However, the company's high volatility and sluggish revenue and earnings growth rates are concerns. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment also suggest a hold decision. Overall, while Maruti's financial health is robust, its growth prospects need to improve to sustain investor confidence."
