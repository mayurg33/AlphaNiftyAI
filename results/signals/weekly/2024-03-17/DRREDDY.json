  "reasoning": "The stock's relatively low volatility and decent profitability profile make it an attractive option. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The news sentiment is likely to be negative due to the GST penalty notice, which may lead to a decline in the stock price. Considering these factors, I would recommend a HOLD decision for now."
