  "sharpe_ratio": -0.88,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong earnings growth and decent revenue growth suggest a stable business. The stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are weaknesses, but the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and easing inflation. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock."
