  "sharpe_ratio": -0.21,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns, as indicated by the Sharpe Ratio, suggest a risky investment. Additionally, the company's stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The negative news sentiment and historical data suggesting a negative impact on the stock price from electoral bond-related news further support a sell decision."
