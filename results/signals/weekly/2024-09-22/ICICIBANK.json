  "sharpe_ratio": 0.96,
  "reasoning": "ICICIBANK has a strong weekly performance with a high Sharpe Ratio, indicating a good balance between return and risk. The company's fundamentals are strong, with high profit margins and return on equity. Although the valuation is on the higher side, the news sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the banking sector. Therefore, I recommend a BUY decision."
