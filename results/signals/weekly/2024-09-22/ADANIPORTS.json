  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 25.51,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.02,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment environment. However, the company's strong fundamentals, such as high EBITDA and gross margins, suggest efficient operations. The recent MoU signing with Rorix Holdings may lead to increased efficiency and growth opportunities, but the historical context suggests an unpredictable market reaction. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision with moderate confidence."
