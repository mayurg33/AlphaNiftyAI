  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 11.81,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.47,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate risk-adjusted performance and relatively low volatility suggest a stable week. However, the company's high valuation and negative revenue growth are concerns. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment also do not provide a clear direction. Therefore, a hold decision is recommended."
