  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is strong, with high gross margins and profit margins, and a reasonable valuation with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48. However, the revenue growth rate is a concern, and the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high. Given the lackluster weekly performance and underperformance compared to peers, I'm not convinced to buy or sell, hence a hold decision."
