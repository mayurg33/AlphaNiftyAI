  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 25.97,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.34,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. However, the neutral to positive news sentiment and decent dividend yield suggest some potential for growth. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment appears supportive, with a growing services sector and increasing rural consumption. Considering these mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's risks and potential rewards seem to be balanced."
