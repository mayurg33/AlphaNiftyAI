  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 41.19,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.38,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly return of 3.95% is impressive, but its high volatility and moderate Sharpe Ratio suggest a cautious approach. The fundamental analysis reveals mixed financial health, with low profitability metrics and high debt-to-equity ratio, but positive growth metrics. The news sentiment is positive, but the macroeconomic environment is neutral. Overall, I would hold the stock, as the positives are balanced by the negatives, and further monitoring is required to make a more decisive call."
