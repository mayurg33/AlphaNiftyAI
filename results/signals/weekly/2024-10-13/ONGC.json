  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 22.81,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.19,
  "reasoning": "ONGC's strong dividend yield and attractive valuation metrics suggest a potential undervaluation. However, the company's low profitability metrics and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the macroeconomic environment is mixed, with some positive trends in agriculture, services, and manufacturing, but also high inflation and interest rates. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
