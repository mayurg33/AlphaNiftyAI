  "sharpe_ratio": -0.38,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profitability profile and decent dividend yield are positives. The macroeconomic environment is supportive of consumer goods companies like HUL, but the stock's high valuation and slow revenue growth are drawbacks. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock and would hold for now."
