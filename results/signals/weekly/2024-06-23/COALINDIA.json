  "sharpe_ratio": -0.36,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.81% and high volatility. The company's financial health is mixed, with negative revenue and earnings growth, and a concerning debt-to-equity ratio. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, with the potential for a negative impact from the awarding of mines to private sector players. Overall, the stock's risk-adjusted return is poor, and the macroeconomic environment, while showing some positive signs, is not strong enough to outweigh the company's weaknesses."
