  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 5.91,
  "sharpe_ratio": -3.05,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance with a return of -3.37% and a Sharpe Ratio of -3.05 indicates poor risk-adjusted returns. The high valuation with a high trailing and forward P/E ratio suggests that the stock may be overvalued. Although the company's financial health is stable, the slow revenue growth and neutral to negative news sentiment further support a sell decision."
