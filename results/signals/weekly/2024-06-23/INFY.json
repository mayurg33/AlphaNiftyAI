  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 7.11,
  "sharpe_ratio": 1.70,
  "reasoning": "INFY's strong weekly performance and favorable risk-return profile are positives, but its sluggish growth and high debt levels are concerns. The neutral to negative news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment also suggest caution. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's strengths are offset by its weaknesses, and the overall environment is not strongly supportive."
