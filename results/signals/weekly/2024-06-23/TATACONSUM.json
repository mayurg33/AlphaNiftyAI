  "sharpe_ratio": -1.38,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor performance this week, combined with its high valuation and debt levels, make it a risky investment. The negative news sentiment and decline in the stock market also contribute to this decision. Although the company's growth prospects and profitability are positives, the overall risks outweigh the benefits, leading to a sell decision."
