  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, but its fundamentals are strong, with high gross margins and profit margins. However, the valuation is slightly stretched, and the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The news sentiment is positive, but the impact of Cipla's investment in mRNA biotech is uncertain. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
