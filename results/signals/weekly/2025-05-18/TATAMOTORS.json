  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 42.8,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.14,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. The company's stagnant revenue growth, high debt-to-equity ratio, and decline in Q4 profit are major concerns. Additionally, the negative news sentiment and challenging macroeconomic environment for the automotive industry further support a sell decision."
