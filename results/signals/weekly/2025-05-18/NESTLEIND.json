  "volatility": 11.64,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.36,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively stable performance. However, the high P/E ratios indicate that the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, the negative earnings growth and low revenue growth are concerns. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's strong brand presence and financial health are offset by its valuation and growth concerns."
