  "sharpe_ratio": 0.24,
  "reasoning": "The stock has delivered a respectable weekly return of 1.96% and has a strong growth trajectory, but its valuation is on the higher side. The high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, but the positive news sentiment and expansion plans could lead to further upward momentum. Considering the moderate volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio, I recommend a HOLD decision for now, as the stock's strengths and weaknesses seem to be balanced."
