  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 31.92,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.28,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and stretched valuation (P/E ratio) are concerns, but its strong gross margins and EBITDA margins indicate a profitable business model. The positive news sentiment and decent dividend yield are also positives. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and macroeconomic uncertainty suggest a cautious approach, leading me to recommend a HOLD decision."
