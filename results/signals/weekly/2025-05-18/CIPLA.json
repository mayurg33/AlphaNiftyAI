  "sharpe_ratio": -0.18,
  "reasoning": "Cipla's strong fundamentals, including high gross margins and ROE, are offset by its high valuation and debt position. The neutral to positive news sentiment and promising macroeconomic environment are not enough to overcome the stock's underperformance compared to its peers. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's high risk and moderate volatility do not justify a BUY or SELL decision at this time."
