  "volatility": 26.62,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.62,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly return and Sharpe Ratio indicate a relatively strong risk-adjusted performance. However, the high volatility and Max Drawdown suggest that the stock comes with higher risk. Fundamentally, the company's profitability is strong, but its valuation is stretched and debt levels are a concern. Given the mixed signals, I would hold the stock for now, awaiting further developments."
