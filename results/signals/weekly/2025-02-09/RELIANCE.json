  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was modest, but its volatility is relatively high. The company's financial health is stable, with strong gross margins and EBITDA margins, but its revenue and earnings growth rates are relatively low. The news tone is positive, driven by JM Financial's preference for largecaps and Shein's re-entry into India, which could lead to increased business opportunities and growth. However, I'm cautious about the company's debt-to-equity ratio and low growth prospects, hence a HOLD decision."
