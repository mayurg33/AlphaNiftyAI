  "sharpe_ratio": 0.48,
  "reasoning": "The stock has a decent weekly performance with a return of 2.17%, but its volatility is moderate. Fundamentally, Infosys has a strong profitability profile, but its growth metrics are a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's strengths are balanced by its weaknesses."
