  "reasoning": "Hindalco's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative news sentiment suggest a high-risk stock. The company's high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, and the current macroeconomic environment, although supportive of growth, may not be enough to offset Hindalco's weaknesses. With a negative Sharpe ratio, the stock's risk-adjusted performance is poor, leading me to recommend a sell."
