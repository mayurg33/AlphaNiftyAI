  "reasoning": "The stock has had a dismal week with a return of -20.38%, significantly underperforming its peers. The news sentiment is negative, with a significant decline in profit reported in Q2 results. The company's revenue growth is a concern, and the debt position is unclear. Although the valuation seems attractive, the overall trend suggests a bearish sentiment, making it a sell decision."
