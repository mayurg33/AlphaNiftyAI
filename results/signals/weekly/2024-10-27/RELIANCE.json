  "sharpe_ratio": -0.89,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing with a return of -3.02% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.89, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the company's financial health is stable with a strong market capitalization, high gross margin, and EBITDA margin. The valuation seems reasonable with a forward P/E ratio of 20.19, but the debt-to-equity ratio of 36.61 is somewhat high. Given the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision for now."
