  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.49,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is strong, with high gross margins and ROE, and a reasonable valuation with a forward P/E ratio of 10.48. However, its revenue growth rate is relatively low, which is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and low inflation, but the stock's recent performance has been disappointing. Therefore, I recommend a hold decision, as the stock's strengths are balanced by its weaknesses."
