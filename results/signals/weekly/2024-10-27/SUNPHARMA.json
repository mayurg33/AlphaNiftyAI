  "sharpe_ratio": -0.32,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns and high volatility are concerns. However, the company's strong gross margin and decent ROE are positives. The neutral to positive news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment also support a hold decision. Overall, the mixed financial health and uncertain profitability outlook warrant a cautious approach."
