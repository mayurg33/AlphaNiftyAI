  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 4.65,
  "sharpe_ratio": -2.35,
  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, but its fundamentals are strong, with a low forward P/E ratio and decent profit margins. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the pharma sector. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
