  "sharpe_ratio": -0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor risk-adjusted returns, high volatility, and significant decline in value during the week are major concerns. Additionally, the company's rich valuation, high debt-to-equity ratio, and negative news sentiment further support a sell decision. While the company's strong market capitalization and decent dividend yield are positives, they are outweighed by the negatives."
