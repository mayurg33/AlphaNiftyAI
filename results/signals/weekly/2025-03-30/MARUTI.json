  "sharpe_ratio": -1.19,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance is disappointing, with a negative return and high volatility. However, the company's financial health is robust, with strong profitability and a low debt-to-equity ratio. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the automotive industry. Given these mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential for future growth is uncertain."
