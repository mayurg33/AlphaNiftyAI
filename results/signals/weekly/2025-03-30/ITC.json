  "reasoning": "ITC's financial health appears stable, with strong profitability and reasonable valuation. However, sluggish revenue growth and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting improvement in revenue growth and debt management."
