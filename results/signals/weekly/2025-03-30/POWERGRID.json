  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 21.73,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.09,
  "reasoning": "The stock's volatility is high, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating a riskier investment. However, the company's financial health is stable, with strong profitability margins and a commitment to shareholder returns. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth. Given these mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential upside is not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken."
