  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 18.85,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.83,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. However, the company's strong fundamentals, such as high gross margins and EBITDA margins, suggest a profitable business model. The positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, particularly in the automotive industry, support the stock's potential. Nevertheless, the high debt-to-equity ratio and relatively high trailing P/E ratio warrant caution, leading to a HOLD decision."
