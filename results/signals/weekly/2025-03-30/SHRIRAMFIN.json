  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. Although the company's profitability and valuation seem reasonable, its stagnant revenue growth and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The negative news sentiment and declining stock price also suggest caution. However, some brokerages remain bullish, which prevents me from making a SELL decision."
