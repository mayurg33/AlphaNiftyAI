  "sharpe_ratio": 0.87,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly performance and attractive risk-return profile suggest a HOLD decision. However, the stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The neutral news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment also support a HOLD decision, as there is no clear catalyst for a BUY or SELL decision."
