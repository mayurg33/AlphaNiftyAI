  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 9.79,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.80,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate risk profile, strong profitability, and attractive valuation (forward P/E of 3.83) suggest potential undervaluation. The company's expansion plans in China and product launches in Europe are positive developments. Although the debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, the overall news tone is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth, making a BUY decision reasonable."
