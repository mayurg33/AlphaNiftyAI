  "sharpe_ratio": -0.65,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns indicate caution. However, the company's financial health is good, with strengths in gross margins and revenue growth. The high debt-to-equity ratio and rich valuation are concerns, but the neutral news sentiment and positive macroeconomic environment suggest holding the stock for now."
