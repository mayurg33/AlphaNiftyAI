  "sharpe_ratio": 0.30,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest a stable performance. Fundamentally, TCS has a strong profitability profile and comfortable debt position, but its growth prospects are a concern. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, indicating potential upside movement, but with caution due to global macro uncertainty. Overall, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's strengths and weaknesses seem to be balanced."
