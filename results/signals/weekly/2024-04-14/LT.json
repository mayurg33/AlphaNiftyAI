  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 11.63,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.55,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but the company's strong fundamentals, including profitability and growth, suggest potential for recovery. The neutral to positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also indicate a potential upside bias. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and elevated valuation multiples are causes for caution, leading me to recommend a hold decision."
