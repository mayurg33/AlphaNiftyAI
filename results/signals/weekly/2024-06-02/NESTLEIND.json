  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 27.68,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.62,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with slow revenue growth and declining earnings growth. Although the company has strong profitability metrics, the rich valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are major red flags, making it a sell."
