  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that the risk is not justified by the return. Additionally, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and high valuation multiples suggest that the stock may be overvalued. With no positive news sentiment, it's a good time to sell the stock."
