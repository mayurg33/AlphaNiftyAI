  "reasoning": "ITC's financial health is strong, with a stable profitability profile and reasonable valuation. However, its revenue growth rate is modest, and the debt-to-equity ratio could be improved. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but the stock's recent performance has been disappointing. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential for future growth is balanced by its current underperformance."
