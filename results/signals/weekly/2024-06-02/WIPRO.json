  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 27.51,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.45,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is positive, with strong profitability and reasonable valuation. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with growth in agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors. Given the stock's high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further improvement in the company's debt management and market stability."
