  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 35.3,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.94,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's financial health is strong, with high profitability and attractive dividend yield. However, the revenue growth is slow, and the stock's recent performance has been disappointing. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and low inflation. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential upside is balanced by its recent volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns."
