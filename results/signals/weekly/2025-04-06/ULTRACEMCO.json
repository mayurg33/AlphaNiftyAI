  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": 0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance is decent, but its high volatility and stretched valuation are concerns. The company's profitability is a strength, but its debt levels are a weakness. The neutral news sentiment and macroeconomic environment do not provide a clear direction, hence a hold decision is recommended."
