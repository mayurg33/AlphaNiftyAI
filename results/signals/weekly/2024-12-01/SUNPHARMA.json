  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 32.46,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.12,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that its returns are not justified by its level of risk. Additionally, the news sentiment is negative, which could lead to a decline in its value. Furthermore, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative earnings growth and a low revenue growth rate, making it a risky investment."
