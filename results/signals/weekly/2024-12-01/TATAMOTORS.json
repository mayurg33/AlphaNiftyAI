  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 17.55,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.29,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance this week, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. However, the company's low P/E ratio and high gross margins suggest it may be undervalued. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the automotive industry. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, but with caution and close monitoring of the stock's performance."
