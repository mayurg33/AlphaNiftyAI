  "reasoning": "Tech Mahindra's financial health is stable, with a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation. However, the revenue growth rate is a concern, and the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, but the macroeconomic environment is mixed, with some positive trends in agriculture and services, but concerns in manufacturing and employment. Overall, the stock's performance is moderately risky, and I recommend a hold decision."
