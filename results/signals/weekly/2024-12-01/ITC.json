  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 5.33,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.01,
  "reasoning": "ITC's poor risk-adjusted returns and underperformance compared to peers are concerns. However, its strong profitability profile, attractive dividend yield, and relatively low volatility are positives. The neutral to positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also suggest that the stock may not decline significantly. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further developments in the company's expansion plans and demerger process."
