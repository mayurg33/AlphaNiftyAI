  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 19.29,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.27,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the company's sluggish revenue growth and negative earnings growth are concerning. Although the company's financial health is decent, the growth concerns and high volatility outweigh the positives, leading me to recommend a sell."
