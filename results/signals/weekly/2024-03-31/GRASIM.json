  "decision": "SELL",

  "volatility": 57.04,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.30,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. Additionally, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and stretched valuation multiples (P/E) suggest that the stock may be overvalued. While the company's strong market capitalization and profitable business model are positives, they are outweighed by the negatives, leading me to recommend a sell."
