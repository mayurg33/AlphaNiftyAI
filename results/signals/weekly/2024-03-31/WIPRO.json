  "reasoning": "Wipro's weekly performance was disappointing with high volatility and low returns. However, its financial health is stable, with a strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, with potential growth prospects. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's potential for future growth is promising, but the high volatility and debt concerns need to be monitored."
