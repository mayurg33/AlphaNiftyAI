  "sharpe_ratio": 0.15,
  "reasoning": "BPCL's modest weekly return and relatively low volatility suggest a stable performance, but its underperformance compared to peers and mixed financial health with concerns around growth and debt position make it a hold. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but not strong enough to warrant a buy. The Sharpe Ratio indicates a moderate risk-return tradeoff, supporting a hold decision."
