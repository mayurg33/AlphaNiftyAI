  "sharpe_ratio": -0.01,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's stretched valuation, high debt-to-equity ratio, and negative news sentiment suggest a potential decline in the stock market. Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment, although showing some positive trends, is not strong enough to outweigh the stock's weaknesses."
