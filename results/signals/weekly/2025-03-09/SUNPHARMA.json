  "volatility": 22.21,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.28,
  "reasoning": "The stock's moderate outperformance and decent fundamentals, including a strong gross margin and ROE, are positives. However, the high volatility and moderate Sharpe Ratio suggest a riskier investment. Additionally, the company's earnings growth decline and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. Given the mixed signals, a HOLD decision is warranted, pending further evaluation."
