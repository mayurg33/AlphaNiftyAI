  "reasoning": "The stock's modest weekly performance and moderate volatility suggest a stable position. The attractive risk-return profile and low forward P/E ratio indicate potential upside. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and mixed news sentiment for the broader pharma sector warrant caution, leading to a hold decision."
