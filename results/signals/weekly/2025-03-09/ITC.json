  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 23.63,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.28,
  "reasoning": "ITC's high volatility and mediocre return make it a relatively risky investment, but its strong profitability profile, reasonable valuation, and high dividend yield suggest a robust financial health. The neutral news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also do not warrant a strong sell or buy signal. Therefore, a hold decision is recommended."
