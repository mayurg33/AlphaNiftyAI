  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 29.91,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.17,
  "reasoning": "The stock's modest return and high volatility make it a relatively risky investment. Although the company appears financially stable with a low P/E ratio and high dividend yield, its revenue and earnings growth are declining. The mixed news sentiment and neutral tone analysis also do not provide a clear direction for the stock. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision with moderate confidence."
