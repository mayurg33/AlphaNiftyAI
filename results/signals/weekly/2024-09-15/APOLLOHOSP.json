  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 21.27,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.43,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong weekly return and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively stable performance. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and rich valuation are concerns. The neutral to positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the healthcare sector, balance out the negatives. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, awaiting further developments to clarify the stock's direction."
