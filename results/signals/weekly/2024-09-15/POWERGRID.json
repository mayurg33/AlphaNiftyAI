  "sharpe_ratio": 0.60,
  "reasoning": "POWERGRID's strong weekly return and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively low-risk profile. However, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and sluggish revenue and earnings growth rates are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is generally supportive, but the company's fundamentals are mixed. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's current performance is decent but not outstanding."
