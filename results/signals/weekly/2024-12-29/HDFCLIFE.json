  "sharpe_ratio": -0.05,
  "reasoning": "The stock's lackluster weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the company's stretched valuation and high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. Although the company has a strong ROE and profit margin, the mixed news sentiment and negative tone for insurance stocks further support a sell decision."
