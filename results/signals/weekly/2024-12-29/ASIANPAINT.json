  "sharpe_ratio": -0.15,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance has been disappointing, with a decline in value and high volatility. The Sharpe Ratio suggests that the return is not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Furthermore, the company's growth metrics are a concern, with negative revenue and earnings growth rates, and the valuation seems stretched. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock."
