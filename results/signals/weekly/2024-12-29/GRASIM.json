  "decision": "SELL",

  "volatility": 7.52,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.28,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a risky investment. Additionally, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and stretched valuation multiples suggest potential downside risks. While the company's strong market capitalization and profitable business model are positives, they are outweighed by the negatives, leading to a SELL decision."
