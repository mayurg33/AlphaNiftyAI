  "reasoning": "Wipro's decent weekly performance and strong profitability profile are positives, but high volatility and slow revenue growth are concerns. The reasonable valuation and manageable debt-to-equity ratio provide some comfort. However, the macroeconomic environment suggests a mixed bag, with some sectors showing growth while others are sluggish. Overall, I'm neutral on the stock, and investors should exercise caution."
