  "sharpe_ratio": -0.27,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate high risk, but its strong financial health and positive news sentiment suggest a potential upside. However, the high valuation and debt levels are concerns. Given the mixed signals, a HOLD decision is recommended to monitor the stock's performance and adjust the position accordingly."
