  "decision": "HOLD",

  "sharpe_ratio": -0.11,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative return make it a risky investment, but its relatively low trailing P/E ratio and decent gross margins suggest undervaluation. However, stagnant revenue growth and high leverage are concerns. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, with growth in the services sector and automotive industry, but the company's specific issues need to be addressed before considering a buy."
