  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 8.89,
  "sharpe_ratio": -2.14,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, negative news sentiment, and high valuation (trailing P/E ratio) suggest a sell decision. Additionally, the high debt-to-equity ratio poses a risk to the company's financial stability. Although the company's fundamentals are strong, the current market conditions and news sentiment outweigh the benefits."
