  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 6.39,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "The stock's modest weekly return and relatively low volatility suggest a stable performance. However, the Sharpe Ratio indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Fundamentally, the company appears healthy with strong profitability and growth, but its valuation is slightly rich and debt-to-equity ratio is a concern. In the current macroeconomic environment, the Indian economy is showing growth in various sectors, but the stock's performance is not particularly impressive. Therefore, I would recommend a HOLD decision."
