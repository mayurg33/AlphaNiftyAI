  "decision": "HOLD",

  "volatility": 26.8,
  "sharpe_ratio": 0.02,
  "reasoning": "The stock's recent performance was lackluster, and its risk profile is relatively high. However, the company's fundamentals are strong, with high gross margins and EBITDA margins. The news sentiment is overall positive, with multiple bullish calls from analysts. Considering the mixed signals, I would recommend a HOLD decision, as the stock's valuation seems stretched and debt levels are high."
