  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "volatility": 18.04,
  "sharpe_ratio": -1.80,
  "reasoning": "Wipro's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but its strong profitability profile, reasonable valuation, and high earnings growth rate are positives. The news sentiment is neutral to negative, but the company's efforts to realign its global business lines may have a positive impact in the long run. Given the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD decision."
