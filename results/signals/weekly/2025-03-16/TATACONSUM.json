  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 15.37,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.40,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance and high volatility are concerns, but the company's strong revenue and earnings growth, decent profitability margins, and manageable debt levels are positives. The mixed news sentiment and neutral macroeconomic environment also support a hold decision. However, the high valuation and moderate debt levels are areas of concern, preventing a buy recommendation."
