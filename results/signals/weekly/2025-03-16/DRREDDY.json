  "reasoning": "The stock's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.09%. The news sentiment is negative due to the recall of Levetiracetam in the U.S. The historical data suggests that similar negative news have led to a decline in the stock price. Although the company's financial health is robust, the current negative news outweighs the positive sentiment, making it a sell decision."
