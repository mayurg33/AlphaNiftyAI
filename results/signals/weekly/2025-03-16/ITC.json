  "reasoning": "ITC's stable performance with a moderate return and low volatility is a positive sign. However, the Sharpe Ratio indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Fundamentally, the company's strong profitability profile and reasonable valuation are attractive, but concerns around sluggish revenue growth and moderate debt levels need to be addressed. In the current macroeconomic environment, the company's rural consumption and services sector exposure could support its growth, but I would like to see improvement in its revenue growth and debt management before making a buy decision."
