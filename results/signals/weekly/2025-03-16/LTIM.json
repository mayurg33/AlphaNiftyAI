  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "volatility": 29.65,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.78,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor weekly performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a poor risk-return profile. The news sentiment is also negative, driven by the impact of Trump tariffs on IT companies. Although the company's fundamentals appear strong, the high debt-to-equity ratio and rich valuation are concerns. Given these factors, I would recommend selling the stock."
