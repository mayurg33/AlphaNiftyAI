  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 6,
  "volatility": 22.75,
  "sharpe_ratio": -0.58,
  "reasoning": "The stock's high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk investment. Although the company's financial health is strong, the high valuation and negative earnings growth are concerns. The neutral to positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment supporting rural spending and private consumption are positives, but not enough to outweigh the risks. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD decision."
