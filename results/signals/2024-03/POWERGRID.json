  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's negative returns and poor risk-adjusted performance are concerning, but the moderate volatility and maximum drawdown suggest that the stock is not extremely risky. The strong positive correlation with COALINDIA and NTPC may indicate sector-specific factors rather than company-specific issues. Additionally, the decent fundamentals, including ROE and profit margin, and the government's planned investments in the power sector, suggest that the stock may not be a strong SELL candidate. However, the lack of growth and high debt levels are concerns, making a HOLD rating the most suitable recommendation."
