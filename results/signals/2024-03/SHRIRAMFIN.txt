Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite SHRIRAMFIN's underperformance in the past 12 months and high volatility, the recent positive news sentiment, including the company's innovative ABS transaction and inclusion in the Nifty50 index, suggests a bullish outlook. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a strong monsoon and easing inflation, is likely to support rural consumption and services sector growth, which could benefit SHRIRAMFIN.
