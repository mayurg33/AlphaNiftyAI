Signal: HOLD
Reason: While Wipro's fundamentals appear strong, with reasonable valuation, profitability, and growth potential, the technical analysis suggests a negative trend, and the news sentiment is neutral to positive. In this uncertain environment, a HOLD signal is recommended, awaiting further clarity on the company's growth prospects and the broader macroeconomic environment.
