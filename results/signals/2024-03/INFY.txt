Signal: HOLD
Reason: While INFY's technicals and news sentiment suggest a SELL, its strong fundamentals, including profitability and stable financial position, justify a HOLD recommendation. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and stable interest rates, may support the company's performance in the long run.
