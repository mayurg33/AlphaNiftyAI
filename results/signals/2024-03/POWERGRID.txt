Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite POWERGRID's underperformance in recent times, the news sentiment is positive due to the company's solar energy transmission project approval and expected benefits from the government's planned investments in the power sector. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a stable repo rate, narrowing trade deficit, and growing private consumption, which could boost the stock's performance.
