  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance, negative Sharpe Ratio, and high volatility indicate caution. However, the moderate Max Drawdown and high correlation with TATASTEEL suggest that the stock may not be extremely risky. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment shows signs of stability, with strong agriculture and rural consumption, and a growing services sector. Therefore, a HOLD position is recommended to monitor the stock's performance closely."
