  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months is a concern, but the moderate volatility and low maximum drawdown suggest some resilience. The high correlation with TCS, a strong player in the technology sector, is a positive factor. However, the high debt levels and moderate revenue growth are concerns, and the macroeconomic environment, while generally positive, does not provide a strong buy or sell signal."
