Signal: BUY
Reason: The undervaluation of DRREDDY, as indicated by its low forward PE ratio, combined with its decent financial performance and promising growth prospects, suggests a strong potential for price increase. Additionally, the positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, particularly in the healthcare sector, support a BUY signal.
