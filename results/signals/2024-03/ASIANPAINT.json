  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's overvaluation, declining financial performance, and high debt-equity ratio are major concerns. The macroeconomic environment, although positive, is not enough to outweigh these fundamental issues. The news sentiment is mixed, and the price trends indicate stability but no exceptional growth. Therefore, I recommend a SELL."
