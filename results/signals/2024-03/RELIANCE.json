  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past year, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio, indicates a poor risk-reward profile. However, the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown suggest that the stock is not extremely risky. Additionally, the peer correlation analysis does not reveal any strong correlation with other stocks, which could be a positive sign. The fundamentals analysis highlights both positive and negative aspects, such as strong industry position, decent profitability, and revenue growth, but also high valuation multiple, low earnings growth rate, and high debt-to-equity ratio."
