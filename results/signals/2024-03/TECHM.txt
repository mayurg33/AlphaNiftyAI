Signal: HOLD
Reason: The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months, moderate volatility, and high debt levels are concerns, but the impressive earnings growth, decent profitability, and positive news sentiment suggest a HOLD rating, as the stock is not overly expensive and has growth prospects, but needs to be monitored closely for consistent revenue growth and debt reduction.
