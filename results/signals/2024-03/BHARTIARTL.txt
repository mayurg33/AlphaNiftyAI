Signal: BUY
Reason: The strong price trend, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio suggest a BUY signal, while the positive news sentiment and rebound in shares from a 52-week low add to the conviction. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a stable repo rate and growing services sector, supports the growth potential of Bharti Airtel.
