Signal: BUY
Reason: Wipro's consistent positive returns, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio suggest a stable and attractive investment opportunity, while the positive news sentiment and strong fundamentals, including a low forward PE ratio and high ROE, further support a BUY recommendation. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and low inflation, is conducive to the company's growth.
