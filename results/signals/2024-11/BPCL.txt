Signal: SELL
Reason: The consistent downward trend in BPCL's stock price, combined with its high debt levels, low profit margins, and declining revenue and earnings growth, suggest a high risk of underperformance. Additionally, the negative news sentiment and bearish analyst notes further support a SELL signal.
