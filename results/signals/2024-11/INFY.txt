Signal: BUY
Reason: The strong technical performance, high Sharpe Ratio, and low volatility indicate a stable and attractive investment opportunity. The positive news sentiment, driven by the company's strong Q2FY25 results and bullish comments on AI adoption, further supports a BUY decision. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and low inflation, is conducive to INFY's growth.
