  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance, negative returns, and high valuation multiples are concerning. Additionally, the low profitability, moderate growth, and high debt levels suggest that the company may not be able to justify its current price. Although the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, it may not be enough to offset Grasim's internal issues, leading me to recommend a SELL."
