  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's consistent performance, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio indicate a strong investment opportunity. The moderate peer correlation suggests a relatively stable investment. Additionally, the positive news sentiment, strong profitability, and growth prospects support a BUY decision. However, the high debt levels and slightly high valuation are concerns that prevent a higher confidence score."
