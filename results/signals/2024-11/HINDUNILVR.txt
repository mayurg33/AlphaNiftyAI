Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite underperformance and high volatility, the positive news sentiment driven by the demerger of its ice cream business and the supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the consumer goods sector, suggest a potential upside for HINDUNILVR. Additionally, the company's strong fundamentals, including its high ROE and reasonable profit margin, provide a solid foundation for future growth.
