  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers, particularly MARUTI, may indicate that the stock is heavily influenced by industry trends, which could further exacerbate its poor performance. Although the fundamental analysis suggests a HOLD, the overall sentiment is negative, and the macroeconomic environment does not provide a strong tailwind for the automotive industry."
