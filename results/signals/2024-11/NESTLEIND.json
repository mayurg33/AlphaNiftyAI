  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a lack of momentum. However, the company's strong brand, stable cash flows, and healthy balance sheet provide a foundation for potential growth. The mixed news sentiment and weak market conditions also suggest a wait-and-see approach. Overall, a HOLD position is recommended to monitor the stock's performance and wait for signs of improvement."
