  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest an unfavorable risk-return profile. Additionally, the high correlation with peers and negative news sentiment indicate a downturn in the company's performance. Although the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, the automotive industry's growth is not sufficient to outweigh the stock's weaknesses."
