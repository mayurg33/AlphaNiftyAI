  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor price trends, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest a SELL, but the fundamentals show decent growth prospects and ability to convert revenue growth into earnings growth. The news sentiment is neutral to positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of consumer spending. Considering these mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD with a moderate confidence level."
