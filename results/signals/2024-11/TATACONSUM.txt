Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the stock's poor returns and high volatility, the company's growth prospects, particularly in the FMCG sector, and its ability to convert revenue growth into earnings growth are positives. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio and rich valuation multiples warrant a cautious approach, making a HOLD rating more suitable.
