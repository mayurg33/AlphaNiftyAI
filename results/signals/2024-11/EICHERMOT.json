  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past year, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns are concerns. However, the moderate correlation with its peers and positive news sentiment suggest some upside potential. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the automotive industry, with growth in two-wheeler production and sales. Overall, a HOLD position is recommended until the stock's valuation becomes more attractive or it demonstrates better debt management."
