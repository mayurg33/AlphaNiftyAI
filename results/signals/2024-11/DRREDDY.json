  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The fundamental analysis suggests the stock is undervalued with a low forward PE ratio and decent profitability. The growth prospects are promising, and the debt level is manageable. Although the price trend is negative, the macroeconomic environment is supportive of growth, and the news sentiment is neutral. Therefore, I recommend a BUY with a confidence score of 8."
