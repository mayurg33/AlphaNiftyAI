Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the negative price trends and technicals, the company's decent profitability and growth profile, along with the positive news sentiment driven by the successful IPO of its arm NTPC Green Energy, outweigh the concerns. Additionally, the supportive macroeconomic environment, with a stable inflation rate and growing services sector, suggests a potential upside for NTPC's stock price.
