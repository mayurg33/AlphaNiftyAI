  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest an unfavorable risk-reward profile. Additionally, the high correlation with Adani Enterprises may imply a lack of diversification. While the company's growth prospects are promising, the high valuation and leverage concerns temper my enthusiasm, and the mixed news sentiment and macroeconomic environment do not provide a strong catalyst for a turnaround."
