  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has demonstrated strong price trends with a 12-month return of 11.93% and a high Sharpe Ratio of 6.045, indicating strong returns relative to its risk. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a growing services sector, low unemployment, and a stable repo rate. Although the fundamentals show some concerns with high valuation multiples and declining earnings growth, the overall news sentiment is positive, driven by the company's growing electric vehicle market share and partnerships. Therefore, I recommend a BUY with a confidence score of 8."
