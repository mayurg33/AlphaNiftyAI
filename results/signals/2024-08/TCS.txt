Signal: BUY
Reason: The strong news sentiment, with TCS being recognized as a leader in open banking IT services and its stock hitting a record high, suggests strong fundamentals and growth potential. Additionally, the company's profitability and strong balance sheet, as indicated by its ROE and debt-to-equity ratio, support a BUY signal. Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and increasing private consumption, is conducive to TCS's growth.
