Signal: HOLD
Reason: Considering the stock's underperformance and negative growth rates, I recommend a HOLD due to the uncertainty surrounding its ability to address growth concerns and high debt levels, while also taking into account the neutral to positive news sentiment and the supportive macroeconomic environment, which may aid in the company's recovery.
