Signal: HOLD
Reason: The stock's poor returns and high volatility, combined with lukewarm revenue growth and earnings decline, suggest a neutral outlook. However, the attractive valuation, decent profitability, and stable macroeconomic environment support a HOLD rating, as the stock may rebound in the next 3-4 weeks.
