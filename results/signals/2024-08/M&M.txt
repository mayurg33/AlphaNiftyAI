Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, the stock's poor price performance and high debt levels are concerns. A HOLD recommendation is warranted until the company's profitability and debt situation improve, or the stock price corrects to a more favorable entry point.
