  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's negative returns and low Sharpe Ratio suggest it may not be an attractive investment opportunity. However, the low volatility and moderate Max Drawdown indicate it may not be extremely risky. Additionally, the peer correlations and promising growth prospects suggest potential for future gains. Therefore, a HOLD recommendation is prudent, allowing investors to monitor the company's performance and revisit the stock when the valuation becomes more attractive."
