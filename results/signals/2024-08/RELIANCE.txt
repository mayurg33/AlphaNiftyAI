Signal: BUY
Reason: The overwhelmingly positive news sentiment, driven by the potential 1:1 bonus share issue, outweighs the neutral fundamentals and moderate macroeconomic environment, suggesting a strong buy opportunity. Additionally, the company's decent ROE and profit margin provide some comfort, and the stable repo rate and easing inflation in the macroeconomic environment may support the stock's growth.
