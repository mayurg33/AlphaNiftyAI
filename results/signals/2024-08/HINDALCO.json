  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has shown a positive price trend with low volatility, indicating a stable performance. The high Sharpe Ratio suggests returns are generated with relatively low risk. Fundamentals such as low valuation, decent profitability, and strong growth rates also support a BUY decision. The news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, with a stable repo rate and growing consumer behavior, further reinforce this recommendation."
