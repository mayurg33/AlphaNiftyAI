Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the stock's underperformance and high volatility, the company's large market capitalization and stable position in the industry, along with the positive earnings growth rate, suggest a HOLD rating. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and improving consumer behavior, may support the company's future performance. However, the high debt levels and declining revenue growth are concerns that need to be monitored.
