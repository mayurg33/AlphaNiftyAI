Signal: HOLD
Reason: While ITC's fundamentals appear strong, with a decent ROE and profit margin, and a relatively undervalued forward PE, the proposed GST hike on cigarettes and other tobacco products introduces uncertainty, and the macroeconomic environment, although supportive of rural consumption and services sector growth, does not provide a strong tailwind for the stock, warranting a hold recommendation.
