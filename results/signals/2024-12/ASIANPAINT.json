  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a lack of justification for the risk taken.

Although the news sentiment is mixed, the fundamental analysis suggests that the company needs to improve before considering a BUY or HOLD recommendation."
