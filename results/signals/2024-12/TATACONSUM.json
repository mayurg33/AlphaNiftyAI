  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor 12-month return and high volatility are concerns, but the company's strong market position, decent growth prospects, and stable industry mitigate these risks. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment suggests a supportive backdrop for consumer spending. However, high valuation and debt levels are still concerns, making a HOLD rating the most appropriate."
