Signal: HOLD
Reason: The stock's poor performance and high volatility, combined with concerns over profitability and debt levels, suggest a hold position. However, the strong correlation with JSWSTEEL and potential upside indicated by the forward PE ratio warrant close monitoring of the stock's performance and industry developments. Additionally, the neutral to bearish news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic trends support a hold decision until further clarity emerges.
