  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a high-risk profile. Additionally, the high correlation with Reliance and UltraTech Cement suggests that GRASIM may be subject to similar market and industry trends, which could continue to weigh on its performance. The fundamentals also suggest overvaluation, low profitability, and high leverage, further supporting a SELL recommendation."
