  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has demonstrated strong performance with consistent returns across 12, 6, and 3-month periods, indicating a stable growth trend. The low volatility and high Sharpe Ratio suggest that the returns are significantly higher than the risk taken. Additionally, the lack of strong correlation with peers indicates that M&M can be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio, making it an attractive buy opportunity."
