  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's declining price trend, negative Sharpe Ratio, and significant maximum drawdown indicate poor performance.

Although the macroeconomic environment is generally positive, it may not be enough to offset LTIM's poor fundamentals and declining stock price."
