Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite underperforming in the past 12 months, RELIANCE's strong earnings and record pre-tax profit, combined with a positive news sentiment and a supportive macroeconomic environment, suggest a potential turnaround, making it a buy. The company's decent revenue growth and reasonable profit margin also support this recommendation.
