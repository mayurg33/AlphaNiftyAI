  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, indicates a poor risk-reward profile. However, the moderate peer correlation and decent fundamentals, such as attractive forward PE and reasonable ROE, suggest that the stock may still have potential. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment appears to be supportive, with strong agriculture and rural consumption, growing services sector, and easing inflation. Overall, I recommend holding the stock for now and monitoring its performance closely for any signs of improvement."
