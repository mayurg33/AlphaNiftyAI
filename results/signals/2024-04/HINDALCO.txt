Signal: BUY
Reason: Hindalco's consistent returns across different time frames, high Sharpe Ratio, and decent fundamentals, combined with a supportive macroeconomic environment, suggest a strong potential for further growth. The stock's moderate volatility and low max drawdown also indicate its ability to weather market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's appeal against the penalty levied under the Customs Act is a positive development, further supporting the BUY signal.
