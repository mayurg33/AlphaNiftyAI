Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the stock's poor performance and high volatility, the company's decent fundamentals, such as its ROE and earnings growth rate, suggest that it may not be a complete sell-off. Additionally, the neutral to positive news sentiment and the supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector, may help stabilize the stock's performance.
