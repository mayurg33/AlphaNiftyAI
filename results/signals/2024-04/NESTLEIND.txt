Signal: HOLD
Reason: The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months, combined with its poor risk-adjusted returns and moderate volatility, do not make a compelling case for buying, while the high correlation with Britannia Industries and decent fundamentals suggest holding and monitoring its performance closely. Additionally, the neutral news sentiment and stable macroeconomic environment do not warrant a strong sell signal.
