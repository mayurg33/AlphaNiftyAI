  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "Considering the poor price trends, with a 12-month return of -3.58% and high volatility, a SELL rating is initially suggested. However, the fundamentals are average, with a decent ROE and healthy balance sheet, which warrants a HOLD rating. The news sentiment is positive, but not strong enough to override the overall neutral sentiment. The macroeconomic environment is favorable, with a growing services sector and stable interest rates, but its impact on the stock is uncertain. Therefore, a HOLD rating is recommended, with a moderate confidence level."
