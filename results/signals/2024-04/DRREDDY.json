  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months is a concern, but the fundamentals suggest it is undervalued with a strong growth profile. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a strong monsoon season, stable interest rates, and a narrowing trade deficit. While the news sentiment is neutral, the overall analysis suggests a BUY opportunity."
