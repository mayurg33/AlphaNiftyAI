Signal: BUY
Reason: The strong price trend, low volatility, and attractive Sharpe Ratio suggest a relatively stable and profitable investment opportunity. The positive news sentiment, driven by the long-term supply deal and capacity expansion plans, indicates potential growth opportunities. Additionally, the strong macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and easing inflation, supports the BUY signal.
