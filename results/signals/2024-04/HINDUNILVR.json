  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed recently with negative returns across all time frames, and its Sharpe Ratio indicates that the return is not justified by its risk. However, its moderate volatility and relatively low Max Drawdown suggest that it may be due for a rebound. Additionally, the company's focus on six key categories and domestic volume growth of 2% suggest potential for gradual improvement in FMCG demand, making it a hold for now."
