  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance is evident from its negative returns across all time frames, poor risk-adjusted performance, and moderate volatility. The negative news sentiment, including RBI's curbs and penalties, further dampens the bank's growth prospects. Although the fundamentals are decent, the negative growth rates and lack of correlation with peers suggest a SELL recommendation. The macroeconomic environment, while showing some positive signs, does not outweigh the stock's underperformance and negative news sentiment."
