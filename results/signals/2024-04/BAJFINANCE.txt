Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the stock's underperformance and poor technical indicators, the strong fundamentals, including a low forward PE and high ROE, suggest a buying opportunity. However, the recent rally and steep valuation multiple make it prudent to hold for now, awaiting a potential correction or consolidation. The macroeconomic environment, with a stable repo rate and growing services sector, also supports a neutral outlook.
