Signal: BUY
Reason: NTPC's consistent performance, low volatility, and attractive Sharpe Ratio make it a relatively safe and profitable investment opportunity, while its strong fundamentals, including revenue and earnings growth, and positive news sentiment driven by its clean energy initiatives, further support a BUY signal, especially in a macroeconomic environment with stable interest rates and moderate inflation.
