Signal: BUY
Reason: The strong technical performance, high Sharpe Ratio, and low max drawdown suggest that LTIM is a consistent performer with minimal risk. The positive news sentiment, including the recent large deal win and digital innovation hub launch, indicates strong growth potential. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a stable agriculture sector, growing services sector, and low unemployment, supports a BUY signal.
