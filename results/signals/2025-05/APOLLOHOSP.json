  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months, negative Sharpe Ratio, and high correlation with peers suggest caution. However, the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown indicate that the stock is not extremely risky. Fundamentally, the high valuation, low profitability, and high leverage are concerns, but the growth prospects are promising. Considering the mixed signals, I recommend a HOLD, with a confidence score of 7, as the stock's performance needs to be monitored before making a buy or sell decision."
