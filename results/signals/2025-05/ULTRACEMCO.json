  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's negative returns, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate poor investment potential. Additionally, the high PE ratios, moderate revenue growth, and slow earnings growth do not justify the current valuation. The high debt level and low profit margin further increase the risk profile. While the news sentiment is positive, the fundamental analysis and price trends suggest a stronger case for selling."
