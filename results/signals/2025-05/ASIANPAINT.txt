Signal: HOLD
Reason: Considering the stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high valuation, and concerning growth prospects, a HOLD signal is recommended. However, the moderate correlation with peers and relatively low volatility suggest that the stock may not be overly risky, and a turnaround in fundamentals or a more attractive entry point could justify a BUY in the future.
