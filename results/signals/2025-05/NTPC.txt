Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, the attractive forward PE, decent profitability, and strong earnings growth suggest undervaluation. The positive news sentiment, driven by NTPC's Q4 profit rise and green energy expansion plans, further supports a BUY signal. Additionally, the stable macroeconomic environment, with a projected agricultural growth rate of 4.5% and steady rural spending, bodes well for the company's future performance.
