  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's strong price trends and favorable risk-return profile suggest a BUY, but the negative revenue growth and high debt-to-equity ratio raise concerns. The neutral to slightly bearish news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment further support a HOLD recommendation, as it allows investors to wait and observe how the company addresses its challenges and improves its financial performance."
