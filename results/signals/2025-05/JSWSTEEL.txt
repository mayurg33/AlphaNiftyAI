Signal: HOLD
Reason: JSW Steel has shown stable price performance in recent months, with moderate volatility and a neutral Sharpe Ratio, indicating balanced risk-adjusted returns. Fundamentally, the company maintains healthy revenues and capacity expansion plans, but faces margin pressure due to input cost fluctuations and global steel demand uncertainty. News sentiment is mixed, reflecting cautious optimism in the industry. Given these balanced factors and no strong momentum either way, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate.
