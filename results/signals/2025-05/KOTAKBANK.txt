Signal: HOLD
Reason: For May 2025, Kotak Mahindra Bank showed signs of stabilizing after Aprilâ€™s decline. While price recovery was limited, the stock did not continue its downward momentum. Fundamentally, early signs of margin improvement and controlled NPAs emerged, though loan growth remained subdued. News sentiment turned neutral, with coverage focusing on restructuring efforts and cautious optimism around digital expansion. The macroeconomic environment stayed moderately tight, offering no strong tailwind. With risk-reward appearing balanced and no strong catalysts in sight, a HOLD is recommended for May 2025.
