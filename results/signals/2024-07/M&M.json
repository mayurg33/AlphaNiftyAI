  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has shown steady returns over the past 12 months, with a low volatility and attractive Sharpe Ratio. The company's fundamentals, such as profitability and growth prospects, are decent. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment is favorable, with a strong monsoon season and growth in the services sector, which could benefit M&M's business. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, which is why the confidence score is not higher."
