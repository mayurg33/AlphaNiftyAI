Signal: HOLD
Reason: While M&M's steady returns, low volatility, and attractive Sharpe Ratio suggest a BUY signal, concerns over its high debt-to-equity ratio and slightly high valuation temper our enthusiasm. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, although generally positive, does not provide a strong tailwind for the stock.
