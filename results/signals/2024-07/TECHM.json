  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has shown consistent returns across all time frames, low volatility, and a high Sharpe Ratio, indicating strong upside potential with relatively low risk. The positive correlation with TCS, a leading player in the same industry, suggests that TECHM is likely to continue its upward trend. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector, low inflation, and a stable interest rate, which should benefit TECHM's business."
