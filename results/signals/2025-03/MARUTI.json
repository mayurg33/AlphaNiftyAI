  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, indicate that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. However, the company's strong market position, healthy balance sheet, and positive brokerages' recommendations suggest that the stock's long-term prospects remain intact. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, particularly in the automotive industry, seems supportive. Therefore, a HOLD rating is recommended, with a confidence score of 7, as the stock's current price may be close to its bottom, and a potential rebound cannot be ruled out."
