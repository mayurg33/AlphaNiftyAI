Signal: HOLD
Reason: While the fundamental analysis suggests a BUY due to Wipro's strong business model and growth potential, the technical analysis indicates a SELL due to the stock's poor performance and high volatility. The news sentiment is mixed, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive, but not overwhelmingly bullish, leading to a neutral HOLD recommendation.
