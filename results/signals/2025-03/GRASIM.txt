Signal: BUY
Reason: The strong technical performance, with a 9.83% return in the past 12 months and a high Sharpe Ratio, suggests that GRASIM is a good investment opportunity. Additionally, the overwhelmingly positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, with a strong services sector and growing private consumption, support a bullish outlook for the stock.
