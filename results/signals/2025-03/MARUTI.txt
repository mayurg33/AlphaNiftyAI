Signal: HOLD
Reason: Maruti's poor price performance, high valuation, and low earnings growth are concerns, but its strong market position, healthy balance sheet, and positive brokerages' recommendations suggest a HOLD rating, as the stock's long-term prospects remain intact, and a potential rebound cannot be ruled out.
