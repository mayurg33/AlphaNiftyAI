Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite concerns over valuation and debt levels, the stock's strong technical performance, positive news sentiment, and supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the healthcare sector, suggest a BUY signal. The company's strategic acquisitions and strong financials have driven the stock's rally, and the overall positive sentiment is likely to continue.
