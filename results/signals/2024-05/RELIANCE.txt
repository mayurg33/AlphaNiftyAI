Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's negative returns and poor Sharpe Ratio, the overwhelmingly positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, including strong growth in the services sector and low inflation, suggest that RELIANCE is poised for a potential increase in its stock price. Additionally, the company's decent profitability and revenue growth rate provide a solid foundation for future performance.
