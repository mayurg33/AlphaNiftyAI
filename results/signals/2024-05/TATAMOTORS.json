  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggest caution. However, the relatively low PE ratio and decent ROE indicate potential value. The mixed news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, which is generally positive but with some concerns, further support a HOLD decision. Overall, it's prudent to wait for improvement in profitability, growth, and leverage before making a BUY or SELL decision."
