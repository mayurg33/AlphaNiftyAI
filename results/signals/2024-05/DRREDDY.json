  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor price trends and high volatility are concerning, but the fundamentals suggest strong growth prospects, decent profitability, and a low forward PE ratio, making it undervalued. The neutral news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, which indicates a growing services sector and low inflation, also support a buy decision. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern that needs to be monitored."
