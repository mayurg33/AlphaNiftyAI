  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's negative returns and poor risk-adjusted performance are concerns, but the moderate volatility and correlation with peers suggest it may not be heavily oversold. Fundamentals are mixed, with decent profitability and earnings growth, but high valuation and debt levels. The positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment are offset by the stock's underperformance, leading to a HOLD recommendation."
