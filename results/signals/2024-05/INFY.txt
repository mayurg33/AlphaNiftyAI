Signal: HOLD
Reason: INFY's moderate return and volatility, combined with its relatively good risk-adjusted return and low maximum drawdown, suggest a stable investment. However, concerns around slow revenue growth and negative earnings growth, as well as high correlation with industry peers, warrant a cautious approach. The neutral to mildly positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also support a hold position.
