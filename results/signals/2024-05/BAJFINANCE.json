  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio suggest caution. However, the moderate maximum drawdown and average peer correlation indicate that the stock is not excessively risky. Fundamentals such as profitability and growth rates are encouraging, but high valuation and debt levels are concerns. Macroeconomic environment is positive, but not strong enough to outweigh the stock's weaknesses."
