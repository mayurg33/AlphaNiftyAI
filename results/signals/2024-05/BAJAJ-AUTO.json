  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate poor investment potential. Additionally, the max drawdown suggests a decline in value. Fundamentally, the stock is overvalued, has moderate profitability, and concerning debt levels. While the macroeconomic environment is positive, it may not be enough to offset the stock's weaknesses."
