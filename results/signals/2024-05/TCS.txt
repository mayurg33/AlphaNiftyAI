Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite underperforming in the last 12 months, TCS has a strong profitability profile, a healthy balance sheet, and a positive news sentiment, which suggests a strong potential for growth. The improving macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector, and the company's focus on GenAI also support a BUY signal.
