Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's poor performance in the past year, its strong fundamentals, including a low forward PE ratio, decent ROE, and impressive growth prospects, suggest that it has the potential to deliver strong returns in the future. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a stable repo rate and growing private consumption, supports the company's growth momentum.
