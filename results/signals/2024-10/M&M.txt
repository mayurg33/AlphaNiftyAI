Signal: HOLD
Reason: Considering M&M's poor price performance, high volatility, and negative correlation with TECHM, I recommend a HOLD. However, the company's strong growth prospects, decent profitability, and positive developments in the automotive industry suggest that it may be wise to wait for the stock to correct or for the company to address its debt concerns before re-entering.
