  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's decline in price and negative returns over the past 12 months are concerns. The fundamentals analysis reveals that the stock is overvalued, with high PE ratios and low profit margins. Although the macroeconomic environment is positive, it may not be enough to outweigh the company-specific issues. The news sentiment is positive, but it's not sufficient to change the overall negative outlook."
