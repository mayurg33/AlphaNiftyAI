  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance and high volatility are concerns, but the fundamentals suggest a fairly valued stock with decent profitability and growth. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector and low inflation. However, the company-specific issues and high leverage ratio warrant a cautious approach, leading to a HOLD recommendation."
