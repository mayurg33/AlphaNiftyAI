  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high volatility, and unfavorable risk-return profile suggest a SELL. Additionally, the company's financial performance and growth prospects are weak, with a low profit margin and high debt levels. The macroeconomic environment, although positive, is not strong enough to outweigh the company's internal issues. Therefore, I recommend a SELL with a confidence score of 8."
