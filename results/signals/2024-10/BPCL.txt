Signal: SELL
Reason: The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and unfavorable risk-return profile, combined with its weak financial performance, high debt levels, and declining revenue and earnings growth, suggest a SELL signal. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, although supportive of rural spending and services sector growth, does not outweigh the company's internal struggles.
