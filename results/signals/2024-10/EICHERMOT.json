  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's negative returns and high volatility are concerns, but the moderate peer correlation suggests it's not underperforming its industry peers. The company's strong profitability and growth prospects are positives, but high debt levels and slightly rich valuation are negatives. The mixed news sentiment and volatile auto sector also warrant caution, making a hold decision the most prudent choice."
