Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the stock's poor returns and high volatility, the company's decent ROE and profit margin suggest a strong underlying business. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, particularly the growth in rural consumption and services sector, may support the company's performance. However, the high valuation and concerns around earnings growth warrant a neutral outlook.
