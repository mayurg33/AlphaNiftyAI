Signal: SELL
Reason: The stock's poor technical performance, negative news sentiment, and concerning fundamentals such as negative revenue growth and high trailing PE ratio outweigh the potential undervaluation suggested by the forward PE ratio, making it a sell recommendation. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, although generally positive, does not seem to be benefiting the bank specifically.
