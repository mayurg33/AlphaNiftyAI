Signal: HOLD
Reason: Considering TCS's underperformance in the last 12 months, high valuation, and declining earnings growth, a HOLD signal is recommended. However, the company's strong ROE, healthy balance sheet, and efforts to accelerate AI adoption are positives that prevent a SELL signal. A wait-and-watch approach is suggested until earnings growth improves.
