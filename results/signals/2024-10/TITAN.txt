Signal: SELL
Reason: The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high valuation multiples, low ROE, and high debt-to-equity ratio, suggest that the stock is overvalued and may not be able to justify its current price. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, although showing some positive signs, does not seem to be strong enough to support a significant price increase.
