  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a lack of attractiveness. However, the average peer correlation is relatively low, suggesting some diversification benefits. Additionally, the high correlation with NESTLEIND may indicate industry-specific trends. Fundamentals such as high valuation, low profit margin, and high debt/equity ratio are concerns, but the positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment provide some counterbalance."
