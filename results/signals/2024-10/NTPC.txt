Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's poor performance and high correlation with peers, NTPC's attractive forward PE, decent profitability, and strong earnings growth make it a BUY. The positive news sentiment, including the company's strong Q2 results and upcoming IPO of its subsidiary, further supports this recommendation. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and low inflation, is conducive to the company's growth.
