  "decision": "BUY",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has demonstrated strong price trends with consistent returns and low volatility. The Sharpe Ratio suggests high returns relative to risk. Additionally, the positive news sentiment and macroeconomic environment, particularly in the automotive industry, support the company's growth prospects. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, which reduces my confidence level."
