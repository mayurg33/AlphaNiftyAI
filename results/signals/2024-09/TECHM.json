  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor price trends, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest a SELL. However, the fundamental analysis reveals a mixed bag, with decent profitability, impressive earnings growth, and reasonable valuation, but also high debt-to-equity ratio and low revenue growth. The news sentiment is also neutral. Considering the macroeconomic environment, the Indian economy is showing growth in various sectors, which could benefit Tech Mahindra. Overall, a HOLD decision is recommended, as the stock's pros and cons are balanced, and it's prudent to monitor its performance closely before making a buying or selling decision."
