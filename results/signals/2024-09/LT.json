  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed in the recent past with negative returns across all timeframes. The high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that the returns are not justified by the risk taken. However, the moderate to high correlation with its peers suggests that LT may move in tandem with the broader market or industry trends. Additionally, the news sentiment is positive, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive, but the fundamental analysis raises concerns about valuation and debt levels."
