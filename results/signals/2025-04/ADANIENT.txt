Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the lackluster price trends and technicals, the overwhelmingly positive news sentiment and strong macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector and consumer behavior, suggest a potential upside for ADANIENT. Additionally, the company's decent earnings growth and relatively high ROE provide a fundamental basis for a BUY signal.
