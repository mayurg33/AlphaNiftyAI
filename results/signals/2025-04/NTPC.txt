Signal: BUY
Reason: The undervaluation of NTPC, as indicated by its low PE ratio, combined with its decent ROE, healthy profit margin, and impressive earnings growth, suggests a strong potential for growth. Additionally, the positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and increasing private consumption, support a BUY recommendation.
