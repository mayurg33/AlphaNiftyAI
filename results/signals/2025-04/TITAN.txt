Reason: The stock's strong technical performance, with a high Sharpe Ratio and low maximum drawdown, suggests a consistent and resilient performance. Additionally, the overwhelmingly positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, with growing rural consumption and a strong services sector, support a BUY signal.
