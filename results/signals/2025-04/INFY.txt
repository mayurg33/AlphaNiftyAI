Reason: The combination of INFY's underperformance in the past 12 months, negative earnings growth, and missed growth guidance in Q4 results, along with the company's announcement of lower-than-expected revenue growth for FY26, suggests a slowdown in growth, which is likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, although showing some positive signs, is not strong enough to outweigh the company-specific concerns.
