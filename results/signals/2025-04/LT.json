  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed in the short term, with a return of -2.79%, and has a high volatility and poor risk-adjusted return. However, the strong correlation with RELIANCE and moderate correlations with other peers suggest that it may be influenced by broader market trends. Additionally, the company's strong growth trajectory and decent profitability are positives, but the high debt levels and overvaluation are concerns. Therefore, a HOLD position is recommended to monitor the stock's performance and wait for a potential turnaround or improvement in market conditions."
