  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed in the past year with a 12-month return of -5.49%, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the company's fundamentals are concerning, with high valuation, low profitability, and high debt levels. The news sentiment is also neutral-negative, and the macroeconomic environment, although positive, may not be enough to offset the company's internal issues."
