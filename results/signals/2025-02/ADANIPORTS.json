  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months, negative Sharpe Ratio, and high valuation suggest caution. However, the moderate volatility, relatively low maximum drawdown, and strong growth prospects indicate that the stock is not extremely risky. The positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment also suggest that the stock may not be a sell. Therefore, a HOLD decision is recommended, with a confidence score of 7."
