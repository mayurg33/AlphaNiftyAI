  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio and high maximum drawdown, suggest that the stock is not a good investment opportunity. The lack of strong correlations with its peers implies that the stock's performance is not driven by industry or market trends. Furthermore, the fundamentals analysis reveals overvaluation, low profitability, and high debt-to-equity ratio, which reinforces the sell recommendation."
