Signal: HOLD
Reason: The stock's recent decline and negative returns over various time horizons are concerns, but the decent financial performance, manageable debt-to-equity ratio, and positive news developments suggest that it may not be wise to sell just yet. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and stable inflation, provides a supportive backdrop for the company's growth.
