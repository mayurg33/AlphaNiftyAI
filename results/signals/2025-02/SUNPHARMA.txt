Signal: SELL
Reason: The stock's poor return over the past 12 months, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate a poor risk-adjusted return profile. Additionally, the company's high valuation, slow growth, declining earnings, and high debt levels suggest that the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits. Despite the positive news sentiment, the fundamental analysis suggests a SELL recommendation.
