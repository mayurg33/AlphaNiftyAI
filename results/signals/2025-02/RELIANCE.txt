Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, the positive news sentiment and decent financial prospects, along with the supportive macroeconomic environment, suggest a potential turnaround. The forward PE of 20.19 indicates undervaluation, and the revenue growth of 10.5% is impressive.
