  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor return over the past 12 months, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate poor risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the maximum drawdown suggests a notable decline in the stock's value. Fundamentally, the company's high valuation, slow growth, declining earnings, and high debt levels are concerning. While the news sentiment is positive, it is outweighed by the negative price trends and fundamental analysis."
