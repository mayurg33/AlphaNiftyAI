  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor price trends, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest a SELL. However, the fundamentals analysis reveals strong profitability, growth rates, and a decent valuation. The news sentiment is mixed, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of the automotive industry. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD, as the stock has potential but requires further monitoring."
