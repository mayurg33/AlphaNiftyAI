  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor price trends and high volatility are concerning, but the reasonable forward valuation and promising growth prospects suggest potential upside. However, the high debt levels and low profitability margins are significant concerns that need to be monitored. The neutral to bearish news sentiment and mixed macroeconomic environment further support a cautious approach, leading to a HOLD recommendation."
