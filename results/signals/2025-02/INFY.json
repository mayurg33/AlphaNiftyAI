  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed in the past 12 months, but its strong correlation with peers in the IT sector suggests a sector-wide issue. Fundamentals are mixed, with decent profitability and low debt, but moderate revenue growth and declining earnings growth. Macroeconomic environment is stable, with a neutral to slightly positive news sentiment, leading to a HOLD recommendation."
