Reason: While COALINDIA's poor price performance and high volatility are concerns, its relatively low valuation and decent profitability fundamentals suggest that it may not be a compelling sell at this point. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and stable inflation, may support the company's performance in the short term.
