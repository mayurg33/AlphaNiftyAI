Signal: HOLD
Reason: While the fundamental analysis suggests a BUY due to Wipro's undervalued stock, healthy profitability, and growth prospects, the technical analysis indicates a SELL due to the stock's poor performance and high volatility. However, the neutral news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector, lead me to adopt a HOLD signal, as the stock's short-term fluctuations are overshadowed by its promising long-term initiatives.
