  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock has been underperforming with negative returns across all time frames, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns. The Max Drawdown suggests a significant decline in value, and the moderate peer correlation does not indicate strong upside potential. Although the news sentiment is positive, the fundamental analysis reveals concerns about valuation, profitability, and revenue growth. The macroeconomic environment is generally positive, but it may not be enough to outweigh the stock's underlying issues."
