  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months, negative Sharpe Ratio, and moderate volatility suggest caution. However, the low average peer correlation and positive news sentiment provide some upside potential. The macroeconomic environment is generally supportive, but the company's high debt levels and low ROE are concerns. Overall, a hold recommendation is warranted to monitor the company's progress in improving its profitability and reducing debt."
