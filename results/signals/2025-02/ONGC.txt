Signal: HOLD
Reason: While ONGC's poor price trends and high volatility are concerning, its low valuation and moderate profitability suggest that it may not be a bad investment opportunity. Additionally, the company's recent deals and agreements, such as the one with bp, could enhance its production and improve its financials in the long run, making a HOLD rating a more suitable choice.
