  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's poor price trends, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest a SELL. However, the fundamentals indicate a HOLD due to relatively low valuation, acceptable profitability, and reasonable growth prospects. The news sentiment is neutral, and the macroeconomic environment is supportive of rural consumption and services sector growth. Overall, the HOLD recommendation is a balance between the negative price trends and the relatively positive fundamentals and macroeconomic environment."
