Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite the stock's poor performance and high volatility, the attractive valuation, decent profitability, and positive earnings growth suggest a potential upside. The news sentiment is also bullish, with brokerages expecting a 60% upside due to strong AUM growth and healthy asset quality. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment is supportive, with a growing services sector, low inflation, and a stable financial system.
