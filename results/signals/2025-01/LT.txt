Signal: BUY
Reason: Despite LT's underperformance in the past year and high valuations, the strong earnings growth, good ROE, and positive news sentiment driven by its impressive Q3 results and quarterly orders outweigh the concerns, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the supportive macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and stable rural consumption, is likely to benefit LT's business.
