Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the stock's negative returns and high volatility, the company's promising growth prospects, respectable profit margin, and decent ROE suggest that it may be poised for further growth, while the neutral news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the services sector, add to the uncertainty, making a HOLD recommendation more suitable.
