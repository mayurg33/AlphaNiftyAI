  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a negative Sharpe Ratio and moderate volatility. However, the high correlation with TCS and decent fundamentals, including profitability and earnings growth, suggest that the stock may recover in the future. The macroeconomic environment is also supportive, with a growing services sector and improving consumer behavior. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD position, as the stock's performance is uncertain and requires further monitoring."
