Signal: BUY
Reason: Wipro's strong price trends, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio suggest a stable and profitable investment opportunity. The company's fundamentals, including a low Forward PE ratio, strong earnings growth, and reasonable profitability, further support a BUY signal. Additionally, the positive news sentiment and favorable macroeconomic environment, with a growing services sector and low inflation, contribute to a strong conviction in Wipro's potential for future growth.
