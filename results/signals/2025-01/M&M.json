  "decision": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 7,
  "reasoning": "The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, indicates a poor risk-reward ratio. However, the strong correlation with MARUTI and respectable growth rates suggest that the company's performance is tied to industry trends. Additionally, the positive news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the automotive industry, provide some optimism. Therefore, I recommend holding the stock for now, rather than buying or selling, to monitor its performance closely."
