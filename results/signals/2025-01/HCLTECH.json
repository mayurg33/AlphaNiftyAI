  "decision": "SELL",
  "confidence": 8,
  "reasoning": "The stock's dismal performance, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted return suggest a strong downtrend. The fundamental analysis reveals concerns about the company's financial performance, high debt levels, and mediocre growth rates. The neutral to negative news sentiment and macroeconomic environment do not provide a compelling reason to hold or buy the stock, further supporting a sell decision."
