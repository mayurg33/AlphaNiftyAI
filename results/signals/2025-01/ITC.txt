Signal: HOLD
Reason: Despite the negative price trends and technicals, ITC's strong fundamentals, including a decent ROE and profit margin, and a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio, suggest a HOLD position. The neutral news sentiment and supportive macroeconomic environment, particularly in the agriculture and services sectors, also contribute to this neutral outlook.
