Signal: HOLD
Reason: While the news sentiment is positive and the company has reported a strong order book, the stock's underperformance in the last 12 months and high correlation with its peers suggest that it may be subject to industry-wide trends rather than company-specific issues, warranting a cautious approach. Additionally, the moderate volatility and relatively low maximum drawdown suggest that the stock may not be overly risky, but the negative Sharpe Ratio and returns over the last 12 months do not justify a BUY recommendation at this time.
