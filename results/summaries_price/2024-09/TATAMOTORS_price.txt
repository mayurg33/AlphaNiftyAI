Tata Motors (TATAMOTORS) has experienced a decline in its stock price, with a 12-month return of -10.80%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.267, and its Sharpe Ratio is a concerning -5.248, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is 12%, which is relatively high. The stock has a moderate correlation with its peers, with an average peer correlation of 0.5322.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** rating for Tata Motors. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that investors may want to reconsider their position. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant price drops, which could lead to further losses. While the peer correlation is moderate, it is not strong enough to suggest that the stock will rebound significantly in the near term. It may be wise to exit the position and explore other investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
