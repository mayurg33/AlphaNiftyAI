--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

Larsen & Toubro (LT) has underperformed in the recent past, with negative returns across all timeframes (12M, 6M, and 3M). The stock's volatility is moderate, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not justified by the risk taken. The Max Drawdown is also relatively high, suggesting that the stock has experienced significant price drops in the past. In terms of peer correlation, LT has a moderate to high correlation with its peers, particularly ONGC.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** on Larsen & Toubro (LT). The negative returns and high volatility suggest that the stock is not an attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the negative Sharpe Ratio and high Max Drawdown indicate that the stock's risk profile is not favorable. However, the moderate to high correlation with its peers suggests that LT may move in tandem with the broader market or industry trends. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold the stock for now and reassess its performance in the future.
