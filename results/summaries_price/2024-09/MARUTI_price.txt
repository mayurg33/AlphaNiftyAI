The volatility of the stock is relatively low, with a standard deviation of 0.217, indicating a stable price movement. The Sharpe Ratio of 3.777 suggests that the stock has generated excess returns relative to its risk. The maximum drawdown of -0.023 indicates that the stock has been resilient to market downturns.

In terms of peer correlation, Maruti's stock has a moderate correlation with M&M (0.6681) and TATAMOTORS (0.6428), indicating that it moves in tandem with its peers in the auto sector. However, its correlation with BAJAJ-AUTO is relatively low (0.4533).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **BUY** on Maruti's stock. The stock's strong return, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio suggest that it is a good investment opportunity. Additionally, its resilience to market downturns, as indicated by the low maximum drawdown, makes it an attractive choice. While the peer correlation suggests that it is not a contrarian bet, the relatively low correlation with BAJAJ-AUTO indicates that it may offer some diversification benefits. Overall, I believe that Maruti's stock has a strong potential for future growth, making it a good addition to a portfolio.
