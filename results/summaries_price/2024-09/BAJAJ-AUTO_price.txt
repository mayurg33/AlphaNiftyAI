**Summary:**

Bajaj Auto's stock (BAJAJ-AUTO) has shown impressive performance in the past 12 months, with a return of 10.96%. The 6-month and 3-month returns are also identical, indicating consistent growth. The volatility of the stock is moderate, with a Sharpe Ratio of 5.168, suggesting that the returns are generated with relatively low risk. The Max Drawdown of -0.027 indicates that the stock has recovered well from its recent lows. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a moderate correlation with Maruti (0.4533), while the correlations with Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are relatively low.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **BUY**. The consistent returns across different time horizons, moderate volatility, and impressive Sharpe Ratio suggest that the stock has strong upside potential. The low Max Drawdown indicates that the stock has a strong recovery ability, which reduces the risk of significant losses. While the correlation with Maruti is moderate, it is not excessively high, which means that Bajaj Auto's stock can still be considered a relatively independent investment opportunity. Overall, the stock appears to be a good addition to a diversified portfolio.
