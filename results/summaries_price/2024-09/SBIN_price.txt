**Summary:**

State Bank of India (SBIN) has had a dismal performance over the past year, with a 12-month return of -4.17%. The stock has consistently declined over the past 3, 6, and 12 months, indicating a strong downward trend. The high volatility of 0.244 and a Sharpe Ratio of -2.078 suggest that the stock's returns have been poor relative to its risk. The Max Drawdown of -0.068 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis with its peers, ICICIBANK, AXISBANK, and HDFCBANK, reveals a moderate to high correlation, suggesting that SBIN's performance is closely tied to the banking sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's consistent decline, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns suggest that it may continue to underperform in the short term. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers implies that any sector-wide downturn could further exacerbate SBIN's decline. It may be wise to exit the position and explore other investment opportunities with more promising growth prospects.
