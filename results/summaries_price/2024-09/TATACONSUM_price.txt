**Summary:**

TATACONSUM (₹1188.14) has been underperforming in the past year, with a 12-month return of -0.23%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.170, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of -0.027 suggests a relatively stable stock, but the correlation with its peers is mixed, with the highest correlation with TCS (0.4079) and the lowest with TATASTEEL (0.1746).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for TATACONSUM. The stock's underperformance in the past year, combined with its negative Sharpe Ratio, does not make it an attractive buy at this point. However, the moderate volatility and relatively stable performance (as indicated by the max drawdown) suggest that it may not be a good time to sell either. It's essential to monitor the stock's performance and wait for a clearer trend or a more attractive entry point before making a buy or sell decision.
