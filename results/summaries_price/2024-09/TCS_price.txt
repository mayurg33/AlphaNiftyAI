**Summary:**

TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -5.59%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.152, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.689, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is 5.6%, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlations with peers TATACONSUM, TATAMOTORS, and TATASTEEL are moderate to low, averaging 0.393.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance and high volatility, I would recommend a **SELL** position in TCS. The negative Sharpe Ratio and high maximum drawdown indicate that the stock's returns do not justify the level of risk taken. Additionally, the lack of strong correlations with peers suggests that TCS is not likely to benefit from any industry-wide trends. It may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
