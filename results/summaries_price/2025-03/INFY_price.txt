**Summary:**

Infosys (INFY) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past 12 months, resulting in a negative return of 8.07%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.261, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.382, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is 8.5%, suggesting some degree of price fluctuation. In terms of peer correlation, INFY shows a strong positive correlation with TCS and WIPRO, but a weak negative correlation with ITC.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** position on Infosys (INFY) for now. The negative returns and poor risk-adjusted performance are concerning, but the moderate volatility and strong correlation with peers in the industry suggest that the stock may be influenced by broader sector trends rather than company-specific issues. Additionally, the average peer correlation is positive, indicating that INFY is not an outlier in its industry. However, I would closely monitor the stock's performance and re-evaluate the position if the company's fundamentals or industry trends change significantly.
