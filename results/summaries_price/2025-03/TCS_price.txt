**Summary:**

TCS (₹3574.38) has delivered a steady 3.24% return over the past 12 months, 6 months, and 3 months, indicating consistent performance. The stock's volatility is relatively low at 0.155, and its Sharpe Ratio of 2.960 suggests strong risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of -0.032 is also relatively low, indicating resilience during market downturns. In terms of peer correlation, TCS has a moderate positive correlation with TATACONSUM (0.2865) and TATASTEEL (0.26), but a negative correlation with TATAMOTORS (-0.1616), suggesting some diversification benefits.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for TCS. The stock's consistent returns, low volatility, and strong Sharpe Ratio indicate a stable investment. While the peer correlations suggest some diversification benefits, they are not extremely high, which implies that TCS is not overly influenced by its peers. With no significant red flags, holding onto TCS could be a reasonable strategy, especially for investors seeking stable, long-term returns. However, for those seeking more aggressive growth, it may be worth exploring other opportunities.
