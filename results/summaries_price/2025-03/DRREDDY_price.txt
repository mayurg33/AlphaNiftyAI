Additionally, the relatively low maximum drawdown suggests that the stock is less likely to experience significant losses. While the peer correlations are moderate, they do not indicate a strong similarity with other stocks, which could be beneficial in a diversified portfolio. Overall, I believe that DRREDDY has the potential to continue its upward trend and provide a good return on investment.
