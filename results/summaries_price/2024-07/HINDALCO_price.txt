**Summary:**

Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HINDALCO) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -2.94%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.251, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.302, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The maximum drawdown is -0.086, which is relatively low. In terms of peer correlation, HINDALCO has a strong positive correlation with ULTRACEMCO (0.6764) and a weak positive correlation with HCLTECH (0.1565), while it has a weak negative correlation with ITC (-0.0773).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on HINDALCO. The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months, combined with its poor Sharpe Ratio, suggests that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. However, the moderate volatility and relatively low maximum drawdown indicate that the stock may not be overly risky. Additionally, the correlation with ULTRACEMCO is strong, which could be a positive factor if the cement industry continues to perform well. Overall, it may be wise to hold onto the stock for now and reassess its performance in the coming months.
