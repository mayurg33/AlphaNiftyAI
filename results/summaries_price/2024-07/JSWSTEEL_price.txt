Recommendation:

Based on the negative returns, poor risk-adjusted performance, and high correlation with peers, I would recommend a SELL on JSWSTEEL. The stock's recent decline in price, combined with its lackluster performance over the past 12 months, suggests that it may continue to underperform in the short term. Additionally, the high correlation with peers increases the risk of further decline. It may be wise to consider reallocating resources to other investment opportunities with more promising returns and lower correlation.
