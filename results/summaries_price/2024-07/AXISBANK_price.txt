**Summary:**

AXISBANK's stock performance has been disappointing, with negative returns across all timeframes (12M, 6M, and 3M) and a significant decline in price from ₹1260.93 to ₹1166.10 in July 2024. The stock's volatility is moderate, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The Max Drawdown of 11.5% suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. AXISBANK's correlation with its peers, INDUSINDBK, SBIN, and ICICIBANK, is moderate to high, indicating that it moves in tandem with the banking sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** rating for AXISBANK. The stock's poor performance, negative returns, and high volatility make it an unattractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the negative Sharpe Ratio and significant Max Drawdown indicate that the stock's risk is not justified by its returns. With a moderate to high correlation with its peers, AXISBANK is likely to continue to underperform the market. It may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
