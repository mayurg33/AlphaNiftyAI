**Summary:**

Nestle India Ltd (NESTLEIND) has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -3.94%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.144, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.269, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.065, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. The peer correlations with HINDUNILVR, BRITANNIA, and TATACONSUM are 0.7027, 0.5617, and 0.3488, respectively, with an average peer correlation of 0.5377.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on NESTLEIND. The stock's underperformance in the past year, combined with its moderate volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggests that the risk-reward profile is not favorable. Additionally, the high peer correlation with HINDUNILVR indicates that the stock is closely tied to the performance of its peers in the consumer goods sector. However, the average peer correlation is not extremely high, suggesting that NESTLEIND may still have some room to diverge from its peers. Given the current market conditions and the stock's performance, it may be prudent to hold onto the stock and monitor its progress before making a buying or selling decision.
