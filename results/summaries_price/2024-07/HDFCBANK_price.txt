Based on the poor performance, high volatility, and negative peer correlations, I would recommend a **SELL** on HDFCBANK. The stock's returns have been consistently negative over the past 12 months, and its risk-adjusted returns are poor. The negative peer correlations suggest that the stock is not following the trend of its peers, which could indicate a lack of confidence in the stock. Until the stock's performance improves and its correlation with its peers becomes more positive, it may be wise to avoid holding or adding to a position in HDFCBANK.
