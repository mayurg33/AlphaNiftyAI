**Summary:**

ADANIPORTS has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -9.79%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.334, and its Sharpe Ratio is a concerning -3.368, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of 13% is also a red flag. However, the stock's correlations with its peers, ADANIENT, MARUTI, and SBIN, suggest that it is closely tied to the market and industry trends.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for ADANIPORTS. The stock's underperformance and high drawdown risk do not justify holding onto it, especially considering the lack of positive momentum in the past year. It may be wise to reallocate funds to more promising opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
