**Summary:**

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. (DRREDDY) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past year, with a 12-month return of -11.08%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.242. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the stock's return is not sufficient to compensate for its risk. The maximum drawdown is -0.141, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a moderate positive correlation with DIVISLAB and SUNPHARMA, but a negative correlation with HINDUNILVR.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on DRREDDY. The stock's negative returns, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted performance (as indicated by the Sharpe Ratio) suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the maximum drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant declines in value, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlations suggest some industry-related movements, they do not provide a compelling reason to hold or buy the stock.
