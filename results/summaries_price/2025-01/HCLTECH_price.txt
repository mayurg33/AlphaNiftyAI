**Summary:**

HCLTECH's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 9.15% decline in the last 12 months, 6 months, and 3 months. The high volatility of 0.400 indicates significant price fluctuations, which is a concern. The Sharpe Ratio of -2.546 suggests that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The Max Drawdown of 0.146 indicates that the stock has fallen significantly from its peak. The peer correlations are mixed, with a positive correlation with TECHM (0.4926) and negative correlations with HDFCLIFE (-0.103) and HINDALCO (-0.2897).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the dismal performance, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted return, I would recommend a **SELL** position on HCLTECH. The stock's decline in the last 12 months, 6 months, and 3 months suggests a strong downtrend, and the high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock is not a good investment opportunity. While the peer correlations are mixed, they do not provide a compelling reason to hold or buy the stock. It's best to exit the position and explore other investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
