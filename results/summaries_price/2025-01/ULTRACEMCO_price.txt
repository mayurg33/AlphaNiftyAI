**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO, a cement company, has shown a lackluster performance in the past 12 months, with a return of 0.35%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.338. The Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is 0.278, indicating that the return is not commensurate with the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.111 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in the past. In terms of peer correlation, ULTRACEMCO has a high correlation with GRASIM (0.7049), a moderate correlation with HEROMOTOCO (0.3572), and a low correlation with LT (0.2667).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** strategy for ULTRACEMCO. The stock's returns have been flat, and the Sharpe Ratio suggests that the risk is not being adequately compensated. Although the correlation with GRASIM is high, the average peer correlation is still relatively low, indicating that ULTRACEMCO's performance is not closely tied to the broader market. Given the lack of strong upside potential and the moderate volatility, it may be prudent to hold the stock and monitor its performance before making a buy or sell decision. Additionally, investors may consider diversifying their portfolio by allocating assets to other stocks or asset classes to minimize risk.
