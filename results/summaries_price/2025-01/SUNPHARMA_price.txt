**Summary:**

Sun Pharma (SUNPHARMA) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past year, with a 12-month return of -7.73%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.250, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.552, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is -0.098, suggesting a relatively high risk of losses. The stock's correlation with its peers is mixed, with a positive correlation with DIVISLAB (0.5972) and a negative correlation with HINDUNILVR (-0.2677).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position for Sun Pharma. The stock's negative returns over various time periods, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio suggest that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown indicates a high risk of losses, which further supports a sell decision. While the peer correlations are mixed, the overall average peer correlation is low, which suggests that the stock's performance is not strongly linked to its peers, making it a more isolated risk.
