Here is a short summary and recommendation based on the provided data:

**Summary:**

Apollo Hospitals (APOLLOHOSP) has had a poor performance over the past year, with a 12-month return of -7.59%. The stock has been experiencing high volatility, with a standard deviation of 0.241. The Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return, is a dismal -3.630, indicating that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The maximum drawdown of 10% suggests that investors have experienced significant losses in the past. The stock's correlation with its peers is relatively low, with an average peer correlation of 0.146.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate that it is not a good investment opportunity at this time. The low correlation with peers suggests that the stock's performance is not driven by industry trends, making it a higher-risk investment. Until the stock shows signs of improvement in its fundamentals and technicals, it is best to avoid it.
