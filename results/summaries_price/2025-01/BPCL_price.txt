**Summary:**

BPCL's stock price has declined by 9.83% over the past 12 months, with a consistent downward trend across all time frames (6M, 3M). The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.299, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.811, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is 13.1%, suggesting a significant price drop in the past. Correlation analysis with peers ONGC, SBIN, and RELIANCE shows a moderate to strong positive correlation, averaging 0.5529.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for BPCL. The consistent decline in stock price across all time frames, poor risk-adjusted returns, and significant maximum drawdown are all bearish indicators. While the stock's correlation with peers is moderate to strong, it does not offset the negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Investors may want to consider reallocating their portfolio to more promising opportunities.
