**Summary:**

BAJAJ-AUTO, a leading Indian automotive company, has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -8.53%. The stock has been volatile, with a standard deviation of 0.279, and has a poor Sharpe Ratio of -4.329, indicating a high level of risk for the return generated. The maximum drawdown of 10% is also a concern. The stock has a high correlation with its peers, including BAJFINANCE, BAJAJFINSV, and MARUTI, with an average peer correlation of 0.6152.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on BAJAJ-AUTO. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that the risk-return profile is unfavorable. Additionally, the high correlation with peers indicates that the stock is likely to follow the trend of its industry, which may not be promising in the current market conditions. With a 12-month return of -8.53%, it may be wise to exit the stock and explore other investment opportunities with better growth prospects.
