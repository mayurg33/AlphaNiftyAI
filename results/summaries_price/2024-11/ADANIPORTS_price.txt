**Summary:**

Adani Ports (ADANIPORTS) has been experiencing a decline in its stock price, with a 12-month return of -14.66%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.651, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.068, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.201, which is a significant decline in value. The stock has a high correlation with Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT) at 0.9292, but lower correlations with Maruti (0.5128) and SBI (0.4224).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position for Adani Ports (ADANIPORTS). The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, coupled with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggests that the risk-reward profile is unfavorable. Additionally, the high correlation with Adani Enterprises may imply that the stock is heavily influenced by the performance of its parent company, which may not be desirable for investors seeking diversification.
