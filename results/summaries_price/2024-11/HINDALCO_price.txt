**Summary:**

Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HINDALCO) has underperformed in the recent past, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M). The stock's volatility is moderate, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken. The max drawdown is relatively high, suggesting that the stock has experienced significant price drops in the past. In terms of peer correlation, HINDALCO has a low correlation with ITC, moderate correlation with HCLTECH, and a relatively high correlation with ULTRACEMCO.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the current performance metrics, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for HINDALCO. The negative returns across all time frames, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high max drawdown suggests that the stock may experience further price drops in the future. Investors may consider reallocating their portfolio to other stocks with better performance metrics.
