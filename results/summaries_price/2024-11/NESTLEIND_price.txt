**Summary:**
Nestle India Ltd. (NESTLEIND) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a negative return of 2.09%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.178, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.577, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is relatively low at 0.049, suggesting that the stock has not experienced significant losses. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a strong positive correlation with HINDUNILVR and TATACONSUM, and a moderate positive correlation with BRITANNIA.

**Recommendation:**
Based on the poor performance and negative Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on Nestle India Ltd. (NESTLEIND) at this time. The stock's underperformance and lack of significant drawdown suggest that it may be due for a rebound, but the overall trend is still negative. I would monitor the stock's performance and wait for signs of improvement before considering a BUY or SELL decision. Additionally, investors may want to consider diversifying their portfolio by investing in other consumer goods stocks with stronger performance and risk-adjusted returns.
