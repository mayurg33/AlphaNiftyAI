**Summary:**

Coal India (COALINDIA) has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -4.93%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.221. The Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is -3.090, indicating that the stock's return is not sufficient to compensate for its risk. The Max Drawdown of -0.073 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, COALINDIA has a high correlation with TATASTEEL (0.6885) and moderate correlations with POWERGRID (0.2684) and TATACONSUM (0.3399).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on COALINDIA. The stock's poor performance over the past year, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it is not a attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the high correlation with TATASTEEL may indicate that the stock is heavily influenced by industry-specific factors, which could lead to further declines in value. With a Max Drawdown of -0.073, the stock has already experienced a significant decline, and it may be prudent to exit the position to minimize further losses.
