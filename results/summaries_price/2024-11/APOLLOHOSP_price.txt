The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.361, and its Sharpe Ratio is -0.968, indicating that the returns are not commensurate with the risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.099, which is relatively high.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for Apollo Hospitals. The stock's underperformance and high drawdown are concerns, but the moderate volatility and low to moderate peer correlation suggest that the stock may not be heavily influenced by industry or market trends. Additionally, the Sharpe Ratio, while negative, is not extremely low, indicating that there may be some potential for improvement. However, I would not recommend a BUY at this point, given the stock's recent performance. It's essential to monitor the stock's future performance and re-evaluate the recommendation if there are any significant changes.
