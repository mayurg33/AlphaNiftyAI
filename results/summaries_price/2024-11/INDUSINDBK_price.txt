**Summary:**

IndusInd Bank (INDUSINDBK) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -6.27%. The stock has been volatile, with a volatility measure of 0.203, and has a poor Sharpe Ratio of -4.363, indicating that the returns have not been sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The max drawdown of -0.100 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, INDUSINDBK has a moderate to high correlation with its peers, particularly ICICIBANK.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the last 12 months, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the max drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant declines in value, which could result in significant losses for investors. While the peer correlation is moderate to high, it does not necessarily imply that the stock will outperform its peers in the future. Overall, it may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with more attractive risk-return profiles.
