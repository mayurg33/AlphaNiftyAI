**Summary:**
HEROMOTOCO has underperformed in the recent period, with negative returns across 12M, 6M, and 3M horizons, resulting in a decline of 5.15% in its stock price. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.299, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is 10%, which is relatively high. In terms of peer correlation, HEROMOTOCO has a strong correlation with BAJAJ-AUTO (0.6373) and moderate correlations with MARUTI and M&M.

**Recommendation:**
Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The negative returns across various time horizons, poor risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio), and high maximum drawdown indicate that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the strong correlation with BAJAJ-AUTO may lead to a similar decline in stock price if the latter continues to underperform. It's best to avoid investing in HEROMOTOCO until the company's performance improves and the stock price stabilizes.
