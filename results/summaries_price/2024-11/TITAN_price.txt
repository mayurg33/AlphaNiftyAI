**Summary:**

The stock TITAN has underperformed in the recent past, with returns of -1.36% over 3, 6, and 12 months. The volatility is moderate at 0.261, but the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not sufficient to justify the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.052 suggests that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in value. The peer correlations with TATACONSUM, TATASTEEL, and TATAMOTORS are 0.5974, 0.1803, and 0.4991, respectively, with an average peer correlation of 0.4256.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position for TITAN. The stock's underperformance and negative Sharpe Ratio are concerns, but the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown suggest that the stock may not be overly risky. Additionally, the peer correlations are not extremely high, indicating that TITAN's performance is not heavily influenced by its peers. However, a BUY or SELL decision requires more comprehensive analysis and consideration of other factors such as company fundamentals, industry trends, and market conditions. Therefore, a HOLD position is recommended until further analysis is conducted.
