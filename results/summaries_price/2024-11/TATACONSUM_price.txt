**Summary:**

TATACONSUM has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -4.53%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.262, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of 9.5% suggests that the stock has experienced significant downward movements. Correlation analysis reveals that TATACONSUM has a moderate to high correlation with its peers, particularly TATASTEEL.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor returns, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that it is not a attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers, particularly TATASTEEL, may indicate that the stock is susceptible to sector-specific headwinds. Considering the overall negative sentiment, it may be prudent to sell the stock and explore other investment options with better risk-return profiles.
