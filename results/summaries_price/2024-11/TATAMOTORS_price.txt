--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

TATAMOTORS has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -6.76%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.228, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.175, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.085, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, TATAMOTORS has a moderate to strong correlation with its peers, particularly MARUTI.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers, particularly MARUTI, may indicate that the stock is heavily influenced by industry trends, which could further exacerbate its poor performance.
