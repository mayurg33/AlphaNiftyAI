**Summary:**

Asian Paints (ASIANPAINT) has had a dismal performance over the past year, with a 12-month return of -15.51%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.358, but its Sharpe Ratio of -6.392 indicates that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.173 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, Asian Paints has a moderate correlation with M&M (0.2798), but relatively low correlations with MARUTI (0.1256) and SUNPHARMA (0.1399).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance and high risk profile, I would recommend a **SELL** position on Asian Paints. The stock's returns have been consistently negative over the past year, and the Sharpe Ratio indicates that the risk is not being compensated with adequate returns. Additionally, the maximum drawdown suggests that the stock is prone to significant declines in value. While the peer correlations are not extremely high, they do suggest some level of vulnerability to broader market trends. Overall, it may be prudent to exit the position and explore other investment opportunities with more promising risk-return profiles.
