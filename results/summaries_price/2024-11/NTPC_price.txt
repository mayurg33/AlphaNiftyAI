The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.276, and its Sharpe Ratio is -6.094, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is -0.134, suggesting a moderate level of risk. NTPC's correlation with its peers, POWERGRID, COALINDIA, and ONGC, is mixed, with an average peer correlation of 0.524.

Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a SELL recommendation for NTPC. The stock's consistent negative returns across all time frames, poor Sharpe Ratio, and moderate volatility indicate a lack of upside potential. Additionally, the average peer correlation suggests that NTPC is not significantly differentiated from its peers, which may limit its ability to outperform. Investors may want to consider reallocating their resources to other opportunities with more promising returns and risk profiles.
