**Summary:**

SBILIFE, a life insurance company, has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -11.73%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.262, but its Sharpe Ratio is a concerning -6.531, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of 12.5% is also a red flag. While the peer correlations with HDFCLIFE, SBIN, and INDUSINDBK are mixed, the average peer correlation of 0.526 suggests some similarity with the broader financial sector.

**Recommendation:**

**SELL**

The combination of poor returns, high volatility, and a low Sharpe Ratio makes SBILIFE an unattractive investment opportunity. The stock's underperformance is evident across different time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M), and the high maximum drawdown suggests significant downside risk. While the peer correlations are not extremely high, they do indicate some similarity with the financial sector, which may not be a positive sign given the current market conditions. Overall, it's recommended to sell SBILIFE and explore other investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
