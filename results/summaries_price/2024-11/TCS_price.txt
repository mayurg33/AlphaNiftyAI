**Summary:**

TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) has delivered a strong performance in the last 12 months, with a return of 7.19%. The stock has shown consistent growth, with the same return over the 6-month and 3-month periods. The volatility of the stock is relatively low at 0.284, and the Sharpe Ratio of 3.563 indicates that the returns are driven more by the stock's performance rather than by taking on excessive risk. The maximum drawdown of -0.043 suggests that the stock has been relatively stable. The peer correlations with TATACONSUM, TATAMOTORS, and TATASTEEL are moderate, indicating that TCS is not heavily influenced by the performance of its peers.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the strong performance, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **BUY** on TCS. The consistent returns over different time periods and the relatively low maximum drawdown suggest that the stock is a stable investment opportunity. Additionally, the moderate peer correlations indicate that TCS is not heavily influenced by the performance of its peers, making it a more attractive investment option. However, it is essential to conduct further research and consider other factors before making a final investment decision.
