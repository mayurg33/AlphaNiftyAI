The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.200, and its Sharpe Ratio is a concerning -6.577, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The max drawdown is -9.11%, which is a significant decline.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the max drawdown is a significant concern, indicating that the stock is prone to large declines. While the peer correlations are somewhat mixed, they do not provide a compelling reason to hold or buy the stock. Overall, it may be wise to consider alternative investment options with better risk-return profiles.
