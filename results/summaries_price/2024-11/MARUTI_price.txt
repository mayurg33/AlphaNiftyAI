--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

Maruti's stock has been stagnant, with a 12-month return of -0.32%, indicating a lack of growth. The volatility is moderate at 0.178, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown is relatively low at -0.047, indicating that the stock has not experienced significant losses in the past. The peer correlations with M&M, TATAMOTORS, and BAJAJ-AUTO are moderate to high, indicating that Maruti's performance is closely tied to its peers in the automotive sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** position on Maruti's stock. The lack of growth and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock is not an attractive investment opportunity at present. However, the moderate volatility and low Max Drawdown suggest that the stock is not overly risky. The high peer correlations also imply that Maruti's performance is closely tied to the overall automotive sector, which may experience a turnaround in the future. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold onto the stock and monitor its performance for signs of improvement before making a BUY or SELL decision.
