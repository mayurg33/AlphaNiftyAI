--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

CIPLA's stock price has been declining, with a 12-month return of -1.64%, indicating a bearish trend. The stock's volatility is relatively high at 0.226, and its Sharpe Ratio is -0.921, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.085 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis with peers shows that CIPLA has a moderate correlation with SUNPHARMA and DIVISLAB, and a relatively low correlation with GRASIM. The average peer correlation is 0.383.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for CIPLA. The stock's declining price, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high Max Drawdown suggests that the stock is prone to significant declines in value, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlations are moderate to low, they do not provide a strong enough argument to contradict the bearish trend and poor returns. It may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with more promising returns and lower risk profiles.
