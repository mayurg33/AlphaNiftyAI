**Summary:**

Reliance Industries Ltd (RELIANCE) has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -3.47%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.260, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.775, indicating that the returns have been poor relative to the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.086 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, RELIANCE has a high correlation with GRASIM (0.739) and a moderate correlation with HINDUNILVR (0.3747).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance and high volatility, I would recommend a **SELL** or **HOLD** position in RELIANCE. The negative Sharpe Ratio and high maximum drawdown indicate that the stock is not providing adequate returns for the level of risk. Additionally, the high correlation with GRASIM suggests that RELIANCE may be susceptible to similar market forces, which could lead to further declines. Until the stock shows signs of improvement in its returns and volatility, it may be wise to avoid or reduce exposure to RELIANCE.
