Summary:

ITC's stock has been underperforming, with a 12-month return of -2.76%, indicating a decline in value. The volatility of the stock is moderate, with a volatility measure of 0.192. The Sharpe Ratio is -1.954, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown is -0.068, indicating a relatively low risk of significant losses.

 Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a HOLD recommendation for ITC. The stock's underperformance and negative returns over the past 12 months are concerning, but the moderate volatility and relatively low max drawdown suggest that the risk is manageable. The Sharpe Ratio is a concern, but it may be influenced by market conditions rather than the company's fundamentals. The peer correlation analysis indicates that ITC is closely tied to its peers, which may limit its potential for outperformance. Overall, a HOLD recommendation is advised, as the stock may require further evaluation and monitoring before making a BUY or SELL decision.
