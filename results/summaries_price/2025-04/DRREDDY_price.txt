The stock's volatility is relatively low at 0.291, and its Sharpe Ratio of 1.445 indicates a strong risk-adjusted return.

The stock's steady performance, low volatility, and strong risk-adjusted return make it an attractive investment opportunity. The positive correlation with pharmaceutical peers further supports this recommendation, as it suggests that the stock is likely to continue performing well alongside its industry peers.
