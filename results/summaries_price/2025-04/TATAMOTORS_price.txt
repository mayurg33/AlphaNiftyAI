**Summary:**

TATAMOTORS has underperformed in the past year, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M). The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.469, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.028, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of -0.137 suggests a significant decline in the stock's value. Correlation analysis reveals a strong positive relationship with TATASTEEL, a moderate positive relationship with MARUTI, and a weak positive relationship with TATACONSUM.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I suggest a **SELL** recommendation for TATAMOTORS. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate a lack of attractiveness for investors. Additionally, the high correlation with TATASTEEL may lead to similar poor performance in the future. While the correlation with MARUTI is moderate, it is not strong enough to justify a BUY or HOLD recommendation. Overall, it is advisable to exit the stock and explore other investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
