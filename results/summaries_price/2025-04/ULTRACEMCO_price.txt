**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO, a cement manufacturer, has shown a moderate 2.31% return over the past 12 months, 6 months, and 3 months, indicating a steady performance. The stock's volatility is relatively low at 0.242, and its Sharpe Ratio of 1.431 suggests that the returns are adequate considering the risk taken. The maximum drawdown is a manageable -0.049. In terms of peer correlation, ULTRACEMCO has a moderate correlation with GRASIM (0.6244), and relatively low correlations with HEROMOTOCO (0.4221) and LT (0.416), with an average peer correlation of 0.4875.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** recommendation for ULTRACEMCO. The stock's steady returns, low volatility, and decent Sharpe Ratio indicate that it is a relatively stable investment. However, the returns are not exceptionally high, and the peer correlations suggest that the stock is not significantly differentiated from its peers. Therefore, I would recommend holding the stock for now, rather than buying or selling, as it is likely to continue performing steadily but not exceptionally.
