**Summary:**

Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HINDALCO) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -5.89%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.500, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.456, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The maximum drawdown of -0.154 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis reveals that HINDALCO has a low correlation with ITC (0.217), a moderate correlation with ULTRACEMCO (0.3972), and a high correlation with HCLTECH (0.5982). The average peer correlation is 0.4041.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I recommend a **SELL** rating for HINDALCO. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with HCLTECH, a technology stock, may indicate that HINDALCO is heavily influenced by the tech sector's performance, which could be a concern given the current market conditions. Investors may want to consider alternative investment options with better risk-return profiles.
