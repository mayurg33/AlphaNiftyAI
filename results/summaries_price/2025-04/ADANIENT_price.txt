**Summary:**

ADANIENT's stock performance has been lackluster, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M) and a Sharpe Ratio indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The stock's volatility is moderate, and the max drawdown is relatively high, suggesting that investors may be experiencing significant losses. The peer correlations indicate that ADANIENT moves in tandem with ADANIPORTS, moderately correlated with RELIANCE, and less correlated with POWERGRID.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for ADANIENT. The negative returns, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock is not a attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high max drawdown suggests that investors may be exposed to significant losses. While the peer correlations do not provide a strong contrarian signal, they do not suggest a strong diversification benefit either. Overall, it may be prudent to re-allocate assets to more promising investment opportunities.
