**Summary:**

JSWSTEEL's stock performance has been lackluster, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M) and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.618, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The stock has experienced a maximum drawdown of 11.9%, and its volatility is relatively high at 0.430. While it has a strong correlation with its peers TATASTEEL and BAJAJ-AUTO, its correlation with ULTRACEMCO is relatively low.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest **SELL** JSWSTEEL. The negative returns across all time frames, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock is not a attractive investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown suggests that the stock is prone to significant price drops, which could result in further losses for investors.
