**Summary:**

TATASTEEL has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past year, with a 12-month return of -8.52%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.524, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.114, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.178 suggests that the stock has fallen by 17.8% from its peak. In terms of peer correlations, TATASTEEL has a high correlation with TATAMOTORS and JSWSTEEL, but a relatively low correlation with TATACONSUM.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position for TATASTEEL. The negative returns over various time periods, combined with a high volatility and a low Sharpe Ratio, suggest that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with other steel companies, such as JSWSTEEL, may indicate that the stock is heavily influenced by industry-specific factors, which could lead to further declines in the stock price.
