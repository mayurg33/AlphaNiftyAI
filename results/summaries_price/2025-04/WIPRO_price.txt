**Summary:**

Wipro's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -8.04%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.365, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.031, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.112 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year. In terms of peer correlation, Wipro has a high correlation with INFY (0.7098) and TCS (0.6567), but a low correlation with POWERGRID (0.0577).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that the risks associated with holding Wipro's stock outweigh the potential benefits. Additionally, the high correlation with INFY and TCS may indicate that the stock is closely tied to the performance of the broader IT sector, which may not be favorable at this time. Overall, it may be wise to divest from Wipro's stock and consider alternative investment opportunities.
