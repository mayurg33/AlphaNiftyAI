**Summary:**

Grasim Industries Ltd. (GRASIM) has had a disappointing performance in the past 12 months, with a return of -6.54%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.264, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.105, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of -0.099 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, GRASIM has a high correlation with Reliance Industries (0.8857) and Ultratech Cement (0.7605), indicating that it moves in tandem with these stocks.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for GRASIM. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers suggests that it may not provide diversification benefits to a portfolio. Investors may consider reallocating their resources to other stocks with better performance and risk profiles.
