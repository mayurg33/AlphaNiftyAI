--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

ONGC's stock performance has been lackluster over the past 12 months, with a return of -1.38%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.241. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the stock's return is not sufficient to compensate for its risk. The Max Drawdown is relatively low, suggesting that the stock has not experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis reveals that ONGC has a moderate to high correlation with its peers, particularly LT and RELIANCE.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for ONGC. The stock's underperformance over the past 12 months, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio, indicates that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at this time. However, the moderate volatility and low Max Drawdown suggest that the stock is not excessively risky. Furthermore, the peer correlation analysis indicates that ONGC's performance is closely tied to its peers, which may limit its potential for outperformance. Therefore, I would recommend holding ONGC for now, but closely monitoring its performance and adjusting the rating as needed.
