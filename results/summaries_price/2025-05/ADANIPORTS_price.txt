ADANIPORTS has shown impressive performance in the last 12 months, with a return of 13.44%. The stock's volatility is relatively low at 0.326, and its Sharpe Ratio of 5.040 indicates a high risk-adjusted return. The max drawdown of -0.030 suggests that the stock has been relatively stable. In terms of peer correlation, ADANIPORTS has a high correlation with ADANIENT (0.9046) and moderate correlations with MARUTI (0.5332) and SBIN (0.2463).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **BUY** recommendation for ADANIPORTS. The stock's strong performance, low volatility, and high Sharpe Ratio indicate a favorable risk-return profile. Additionally, the relatively low max drawdown suggests that the stock is less prone to significant price drops. The high correlation with ADANIENT may indicate a sector-specific trend, but the moderate correlations with MARUTI and SBIN suggest that ADANIPORTS is not overly dependent on any one sector. Overall, ADANIPORTS appears to be a solid investment opportunity.
