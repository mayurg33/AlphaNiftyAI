The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be the best investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlation with peers suggests that the stock may not provide significant diversification benefits. However, the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown suggest that the stock is not extremely risky. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold existing positions and monitor the stock's performance before making a buy or sell decision.
