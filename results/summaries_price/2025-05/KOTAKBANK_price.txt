**Summary:**

Kotak Bank's stock performance has been underwhelming, with negative returns across all timeframes (12M, 6M, and 3M) and a Sharpe Ratio of -2.884, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The stock has been relatively volatile, with a volatility measure of 0.212. The Max Drawdown of -0.053 suggests that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, Kotak Bank has a mixed relationship with its peers, with a strong positive correlation with ICICIBank (0.4385) and a moderate positive correlation with TECHM (0.3354), but a negative correlation with M&M (-0.0767).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for Kotak Bank. The negative returns and poor risk-adjusted performance are concerns, but the stock's correlations with its peers, particularly ICICIBank, suggest that it may be influenced by industry trends. Additionally, the volatility and Max Drawdown measures are not extreme, indicating that the stock may not be in a state of extreme distress. However, I would recommend monitoring the stock's performance closely and reassessing the situation if there are any significant changes in the market or the bank's fundamentals.
