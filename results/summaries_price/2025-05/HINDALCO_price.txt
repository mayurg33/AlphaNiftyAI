**Summary:**

Hindalco Industries Ltd (HINDALCO) has shown a modest price increase of ₹3 (0.48%) over the past month, closing at ₹633.50. The stock's 12-month return is also 0.48%, indicating a stable but unimpressive performance. The volatility of 0.276 is relatively low, suggesting a stable stock. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.348 indicates that the stock has generated moderate returns per unit of risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.044 indicates that the stock has not experienced significant declines in the past. In terms of peer correlation, HINDALCO has a moderate correlation with ITC (0.5487) and ULTRACEMCO (0.4159), but a high correlation with HCLTECH (0.6842).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I suggest a **HOLD** recommendation for HINDALCO. The stock's stable performance, low volatility, and moderate returns per unit of risk taken are positives. However, the lack of significant growth and relatively low returns compared to its peers are concerns. Additionally, the high correlation with HCLTECH may indicate that HINDALCO's performance is closely tied to the IT sector, which may not be desirable for diversification purposes. Overall, while HINDALCO is not a bad investment, it may not be the most attractive option in the current market scenario.
