**Summary:**

Reliance Industries Ltd. (RELIANCE) has underperformed in the past year, with a negative 12-month return of -0.42%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.229, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.059 suggests that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in value. Correlation analysis reveals that RELIANCE has a moderate positive correlation with its peers, with an average peer correlation of 0.2253.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** recommendation for RELIANCE. The stock's underperformance in the past year, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio, indicates that the risk-reward profile is not favorable. However, the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown suggest that the stock is not extremely risky. Additionally, the peer correlation analysis does not reveal any strong correlation with other stocks, which could be a positive sign. Overall, it's best to hold the stock for now and monitor its performance closely before making a buying or selling decision.
