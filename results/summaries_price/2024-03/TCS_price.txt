**Summary:**

TCS, a leading IT services company, has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past 3, 6, and 12 months, with a return of -5.33%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.237, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The Max Drawdown of 9% suggests that the stock has experienced significant price drops in the past. In terms of peer correlations, TCS has a strong positive correlation with TATACONSUM (0.6502), but weak correlations with TATAMOTORS (-0.0345) and TATASTEEL (0.0406).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for TCS. The stock's poor returns and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it has not been a good investment opportunity in the recent past. Additionally, the high Max Drawdown suggests that investors may experience significant losses if they enter the stock at the wrong time. However, the strong correlation with TATACONSUM could indicate that TCS is closely tied to the broader Tata group's performance, which may provide some stability. Overall, I would recommend holding off on making a new investment in TCS until the company's fundamentals and stock performance improve.
