**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO's stock has been underperforming, with a 12-month return of -3.81%, indicating a decline in value. The volatility is moderate at 0.167, and the Sharpe Ratio is -3.374, suggesting that the returns are not commensurate with the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.067 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year. The peer correlations suggest that ULTRACEMCO's stock movement is moderately correlated with its peers, particularly GRASIM.

**Recommendation:**

Considering the negative returns across all time horizons, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **SELL** position on ULTRACEMCO. The stock's underperformance and high risk profile do not justify holding or buying the stock at this time. Investors may want to consider reallocating their portfolio to other opportunities with more promising returns and risk profiles.
