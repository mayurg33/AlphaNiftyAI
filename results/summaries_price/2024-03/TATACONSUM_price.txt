**Summary:**

TATACONSUM, a Tata Group company, has had a disappointing performance in the last 12 months, with a return of -8.73%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.307, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.256, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The maximum drawdown of -0.135 is a concern, suggesting a significant decline in the stock's value. Correlation analysis reveals that TATACONSUM has a moderate to high correlation with its peers, TATAMOTORS, TCS, and TATASTEEL, with an average peer correlation of 0.4914.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate that it is not a desirable investment opportunity. The high correlation with peers suggests that the stock is likely to follow the trend of its peer group, which may not be favorable in the current market conditions. Additionally, the significant maximum drawdown is a concern, indicating a potential for further decline in the stock's value. Therefore, it is prudent to exit the stock and explore other investment opportunities with better risk-reward profiles.
