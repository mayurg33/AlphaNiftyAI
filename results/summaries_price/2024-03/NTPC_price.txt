**Summary:**

NTPC's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -2.24%, indicating a decline in value. The volatility of 0.353 suggests moderate price fluctuations. The Sharpe Ratio of -0.783 indicates that the returns are not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.125 implies that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past. The peer correlations with POWERGRID, COALINDIA, and ONGC are high, indicating that NTPC's stock movement is closely tied to its peers in the energy sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for NTPC. The negative returns, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate that the stock is not an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the high peer correlations suggest that the stock is not likely to outperform its peers, and the Max Drawdown indicates that there is a risk of further decline in value.
