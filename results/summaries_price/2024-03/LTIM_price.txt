**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on LTIM. The stock's poor performance over the past year, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggests that it may not be a good investment opportunity. Additionally, the negative correlations with TITAN and ITC may indicate that the stock is not well-diversified and may be subject to industry-specific risks. Overall, it may be wise to reconsider holding LTIM in a portfolio and explore alternative investment opportunities.
