**Summary:**

ONGC's stock performance has been disappointing over the past 12 months, with a return of -0.92%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.346, but its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of 10% suggests that the stock has experienced significant losses in the past. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a strong correlation with BPCL (0.7165) and moderate correlations with LT (0.5963) and RELIANCE (0.3856).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** position on ONGC. The stock's underperformance and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlation with BPCL suggests that the stock may be influenced by sector-specific factors, which could continue to impact its performance. However, the stock's moderate volatility and average peer correlation suggest that it may not be a high-risk investment. Therefore, a HOLD position is recommended until the stock's fundamentals improve or the sector outlook changes.
