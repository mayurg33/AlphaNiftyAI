**Summary:**

State Bank of India (SBIN) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -2.18%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.209. The Sharpe Ratio is -1.470, indicating that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The Max Drawdown is -0.082, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, SBIN has a moderate correlation with ICICIBANK (0.2582), a low correlation with AXISBANK (0.0492), and a negligible correlation with HDFCBANK (0.0017).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on SBIN. The stock's underperformance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that the risk is not justified by the potential return. Additionally, the Max Drawdown indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value, which may not be fully recovered in the near term. While the peer correlation with ICICIBANK is moderate, it is not sufficient to justify a BUY position. Overall, it may be prudent to exit the stock and explore other investment opportunities with more favorable risk-return profiles.
