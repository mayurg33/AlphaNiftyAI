**Summary:**

Wipro's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -7.51%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.237, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.770, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The max drawdown of -0.093 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year. The peer correlations suggest that Wipro's stock movement is highly correlated with its peers in the IT sector, particularly INFY and TCS.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The negative returns over various time periods, combined with a high volatility and poor risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe Ratio), suggest that the stock is not an attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers in the IT sector may indicate that the stock is likely to continue to follow the broader sector trends, which may not be positive in the near term. However, it's essential to conduct further research and consider other factors before making a final investment decision.
