**Summary:**

Adani Ports (ADANIPORTS) has shown a modest price appreciation of 1.49% over the past 3, 6, and 12 months, with a relatively low volatility of 0.394. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.747 indicates a decent risk-adjusted return. However, the Max Drawdown of -0.099 suggests that the stock has experienced some significant price drops in the past. In terms of peer correlation, ADANIPORTS has a high correlation with ADANIENT (0.9453), moderate correlation with SBIN (0.2932), and a low correlation with MARUTI (0.2518).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** rating for Adani Ports (ADANIPORTS). While the stock's returns have been modest, the low volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may be a relatively stable investment. However, the Max Drawdown is a concern, and investors should be prepared for potential price fluctuations. Additionally, the high correlation with ADANIENT may indicate that the stock is heavily influenced by the Adani Group's performance, which could be a risk factor. Overall, I would suggest holding the stock for now, but closely monitoring its performance and adjusting the portfolio as needed.
