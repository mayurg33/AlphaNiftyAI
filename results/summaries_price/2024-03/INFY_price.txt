**Summary:**

Infosys (INFY) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past 12 months, with a return of -9.47%. The stock's volatility is relatively high at 0.220, and its Sharpe Ratio is -6.573, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The Max Drawdown of -0.103 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point during the past year. In terms of peer correlations, INFY has a strong correlation with TCS and WIPRO, but a weak correlation with ITC.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the negative returns, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns, I would recommend a **SELL** position on Infosys (INFY). The stock's decline in value over the past year, combined with its high volatility, suggests that it may continue to experience downward pressure. Additionally, the Max Drawdown indicates that the stock is vulnerable to significant declines in value. While the strong correlation with TCS and WIPRO may suggest some industry-specific trends, it is not enough to overcome the overall negative sentiment around INFY.
