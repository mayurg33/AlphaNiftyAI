**Summary:**

JSW Steel's performance has been lackluster over the past year, with returns of -0.72% over 12 months, 6 months, and 3 months. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.251, but the Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.066 suggests that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, JSW Steel has a high correlation with TATASTEEL, moderate correlation with ULTRACEMCO, and low correlation with BAJAJ-AUTO.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on JSW Steel. The stock's poor performance and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at present. However, the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown indicate that the stock may not be extremely risky either. Additionally, the high correlation with TATASTEEL suggests that the stock's performance may be influenced by the broader steel industry trends. Therefore, it may be wise to hold the stock and monitor its performance closely, rather than buying or selling at this point.
