HEROMOTOCO's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.92% and a max drawdown of -1.92%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 6.85%, but its Sharpe ratio of -1.12 suggests that the return was not justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, HEROMOTOCO underperformed MARUTI and M&M, but outperformed BAJAJ-AUTO. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its poor performance outweighs its volatility advantage.
