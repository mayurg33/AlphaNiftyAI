HDFCBANK's weekly return of 0.59% was relatively modest, accompanied by a moderate volatility of 19.4%. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly ICICIBANK and HDFCLIFE, which posted returns of 3.1% and 2.36%, respectively. Despite this, HDFCBANK's Sharpe Ratio of 0.13 suggests that its return was not entirely justified by its risk-taking. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster this week, with a relatively high risk profile.
