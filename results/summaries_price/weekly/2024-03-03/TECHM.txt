TECHM's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -2.04% and a max drawdown of -2.04%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 6.44%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -1.26 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, TECHM underperformed, with M&M, KOTAKBANK, and TCS all posting positive returns. Overall, TECHM was a relatively low-risk stock this week, but its poor performance makes it an unattractive option.
