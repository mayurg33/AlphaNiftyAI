Britannia's weekly return of -0.62% was relatively resilient compared to its peers, with a lower volatility of 9.56% and a higher Sharpe Ratio of -0.26. The stock outperformed its peers, including NESTLEIND, GRASIM, and RELIANCE, which saw larger declines. Despite the negative return, Britannia's relatively lower volatility and drawdown suggest it was a less risky option this week.
