Britannia's weekly return of -1.68% was relatively in line with its peers, with a slightly better performance compared to NESTLEIND and GRASIM. However, its Sharpe Ratio of -0.65 indicates that the stock's return was not sufficient to compensate for its volatility. Britannia's volatility of 10.33% was relatively lower compared to its peers, suggesting a relatively less risky investment this week.
