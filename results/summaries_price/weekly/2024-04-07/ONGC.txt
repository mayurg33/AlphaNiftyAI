ONGC's weekly return of -0.72% was relatively better than its peers, with a lower volatility of 24.89% compared to BPCL's 32.03%. However, its Sharpe Ratio of -0.11 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. ONGC outperformed BPCL and RELIANCE but underperformed LT in terms of returns. The stock's Max Drawdown of -2.69% suggests a moderate level of risk this week.
