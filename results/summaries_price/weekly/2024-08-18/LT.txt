LT's weekly return of -0.1% was a lackluster performance, with a Sharpe Ratio of -0.05 indicating that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The stock's volatility of 9.89% was relatively moderate, but its Max Drawdown of -0.75% suggests that it was a risky investment this week.
