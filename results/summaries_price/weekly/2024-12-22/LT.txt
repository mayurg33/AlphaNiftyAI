LT's weekly performance was dismal, with a return of -6.4% and a max drawdown of the same magnitude, indicating a significant decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively moderate at 8.73%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -2.98 suggests that the returns were not justified by the level of risk taken.
