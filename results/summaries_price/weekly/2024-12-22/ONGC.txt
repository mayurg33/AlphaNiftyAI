ONGC's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -5.84% and a max drawdown of -5.84%, indicating a significant decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 7.23%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -3.28 suggests that the return was not justified by the risk taken. Compared to its peers, ONGC underperformed BPCL and RELIANCE, but outperformed LT. Overall, ONGC was a relatively low-risk stock this week, but its poor performance makes it a concern for investors.
