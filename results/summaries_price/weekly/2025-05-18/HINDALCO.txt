HINDALCO's weekly return of 0.86% was modest, but its high volatility of 36.69% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, HINDALCO underperformed ULTRACEMCO but outperformed ITC and HCLTECH. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.10 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Overall, HINDALCO's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment this week.
