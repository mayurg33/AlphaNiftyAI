HINDUNILVR's weekly performance was lackluster, with a return of -0.05%, underperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was moderate at 13.99%, indicating a relatively stable price movement. Despite this, the Sharpe Ratio of -0.01 suggests that the stock's return was not sufficient to compensate for its risk. Compared to its peers, HINDUNILVR lagged behind, with RELIANCE, NESTLEIND, and TATACONSUM all posting positive returns. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its poor performance makes it an unattractive investment option.
