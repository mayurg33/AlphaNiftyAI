ONGC's weekly return of 1.33% was modest, but its volatility of 21.3% was relatively high. Compared to its peers, ONGC underperformed BPCL but outperformed LT, and was on par with RELIANCE. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.25 suggests that its return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, ONGC's weekly performance was lackluster, and its high volatility made it a relatively risky investment this week.
