APOLLOHOSP's weekly return of 1.29% was modest, but its volatility of 21.17% indicates a relatively turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, APOLLOHOSP underperformed DRREDDY and HDFCLIFE, but outperformed BHARTIARTL. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.24 suggests that its return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, APOLLOHOSP was a relatively risky investment this week.
