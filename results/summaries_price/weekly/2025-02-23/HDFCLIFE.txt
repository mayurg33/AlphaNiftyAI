HDFCLIFE's weekly performance was relatively stable, with a modest decline of 0.06%, outperforming its peers HDFCBANK and HINDUNILVR. However, it underperformed SBILIFE, which saw a 1.3% return. Despite its relatively low volatility of 10.42%, the stock's Sharpe Ratio of -0.02 indicates that it did not generate sufficient returns to compensate for its risk. Overall, HDFCLIFE's performance was lackluster, but its lower volatility made it a relatively safer bet this week.
