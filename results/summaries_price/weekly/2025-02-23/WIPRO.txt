WIPRO's weekly performance was relatively strong, with a 0.33% return, outperforming its peers INFY, TCS, and POWERGRID. Despite this, the stock's volatility was high at 29.49%, indicating a risky investment environment. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.05 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken. Overall, WIPRO's performance was decent, but the high volatility and max drawdown of -2.47% warrant caution.
