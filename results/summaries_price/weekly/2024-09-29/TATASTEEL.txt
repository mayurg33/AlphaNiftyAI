TATASTEEL had an exceptional weekly performance, with a return of 8.16%, significantly outperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively high at 27.46%, but its Sharpe Ratio of 1.15 indicates that the returns were justified by the risk taken. Compared to its peers, TATASTEEL outperformed TATAMOTORS, TATACONSUM, and JSWSTEEL, making it a standout performer this week. Overall, the stock's high return and moderate volatility make it a relatively risky but rewarding investment option.
