CIPLA's weekly return of 0.87% was modest, but its high volatility of 32.94% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly SUNPHARMA and GRASIM, which posted returns of 4.62% and 4.36%, respectively. Despite its relatively low Sharpe Ratio of 0.11, CIPLA's Max Drawdown of -2.19% indicates a moderate level of risk. Overall, CIPLA's performance was lackluster this week.
