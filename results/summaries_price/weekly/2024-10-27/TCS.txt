TCS experienced a relatively modest decline of -0.55% for the week starting 2024-10-27, outperforming its peers TATACONSUM, TATAMOTORS, and TATASTEEL, which saw returns ranging from -4.32% to -5.91%. Despite this, the stock's volatility remained relatively high at 18.95%, indicating a moderate level of risk. The Sharpe Ratio of -0.11 suggests that the stock's return was not sufficient to compensate for its level of volatility. Overall, TCS demonstrated a relatively resilient performance compared to its peers, but its volatility remains a concern.
