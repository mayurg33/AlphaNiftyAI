INFY's weekly return of 0.91% was a relatively strong performance, especially compared to peers TCS and WIPRO which saw negative returns. However, its high volatility of 32.18% suggests a risky investment environment. In contrast, ITC's return of 3.82% with lower volatility makes it a more attractive option. Overall, INFY outperformed some peers but was still a relatively risky investment this week.
