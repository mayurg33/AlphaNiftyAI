SHRIRAMFIN had a strong weekly performance with a 4.04% return, outperforming M&M but underperforming BAJAJFINSV. However, its high volatility of 57.77% indicates a riskier investment compared to its peers. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.38 suggests that the return was not entirely justified by the level of risk taken. Despite a moderate Max Drawdown of -2.63%, investors should exercise caution due to the stock's high volatility.
