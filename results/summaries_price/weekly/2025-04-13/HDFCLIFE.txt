HDFCLIFE's weekly return of 2.94% was moderate, but its high volatility of 27.45% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, HDFCLIFE underperformed SBILIFE and HINDUNILVR, but outperformed HDFCBANK in terms of returns. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.57 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return, while its Max Drawdown of -0.14% suggests a moderate level of risk. Overall, HDFCLIFE's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment.
