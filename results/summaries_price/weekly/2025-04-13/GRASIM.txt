GRASIM's weekly performance was strong, with a 5.67% return, outperforming RELIANCE but underperforming BRITANNIA. However, its high volatility of 43.1% and relatively low Sharpe Ratio of 0.69 indicate a riskier investment compared to its peers. The stock's max drawdown of -1.25% also suggests potential for significant losses. Overall, GRASIM's performance was decent, but its high volatility and risk profile may be a concern for investors.
