DRREDDY's weekly return of 1.99% was modest, but its volatility of 26.64% indicates a relatively turbulent ride for investors. While it underperformed peers like DIVISLAB and HINDUNILVR, it outperformed SUNPHARMA. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.40 suggests that its return was not entirely justified by its risk, and the Max Drawdown of -1.25% highlights the potential for losses. Overall, DRREDDY's performance was lackluster, and its risk profile was moderate.
