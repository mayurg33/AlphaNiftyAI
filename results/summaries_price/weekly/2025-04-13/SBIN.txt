SBIN's weekly return of 0.93% was modest, but its high volatility of 53.06% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. The stock underperformed its peers, including ICICIBANK, AXISBANK, and HDFCBANK, which posted returns ranging from 1.87% to 2.79%. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.10 indicates that the stock's return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, SBIN was a relatively risky investment this week.
