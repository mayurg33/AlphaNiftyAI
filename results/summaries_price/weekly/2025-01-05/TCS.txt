TCS had a disappointing week, with a -1.42% return, significantly underperforming its peers. The stock's high volatility of 25.5% contributed to its poor performance, making it a risky investment this week. In comparison, its peers TATACONSUM, TATAMOTORS, and TATASTEEL all posted positive returns, with TATAMOTORS being the top performer. Overall, TCS's weak performance and high volatility make it an unattractive investment option for the week.
