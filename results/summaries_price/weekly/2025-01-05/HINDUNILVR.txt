HINDUNILVR's weekly return of 2.68% was modest, but its high volatility of 21.2% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. The stock underperformed its peers, RELIANCE, NESTLEIND, and TATACONSUM, which posted higher returns with lower volatility. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.50 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken, and the Max Drawdown of -0.91% highlights the potential for significant losses. Overall, HINDUNILVR was a relatively risky investment this week.
