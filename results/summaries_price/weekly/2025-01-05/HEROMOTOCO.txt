HEROMOTOCO's weekly return of 1.33% was modest, but its volatility of 31.77% indicates a relatively turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, HEROMOTOCO underperformed MARUTI and M&M, but outperformed BAJAJ-AUTO. With a Sharpe Ratio of 0.17, the stock's return was not adequately compensated for its risk, and its Max Drawdown of -1.59% suggests a moderate level of risk. Overall, HEROMOTOCO's weekly performance was lackluster, and investors may want to exercise caution.
