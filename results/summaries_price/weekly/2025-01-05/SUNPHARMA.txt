SUNPHARMA's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.82%, underperforming its peers DRREDDY and DIVISLAB. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 12.64%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -0.57 indicates poor risk-adjusted returns. Despite this, SUNPHARMA was less risky than its peers, with a lower volatility and max drawdown. However, it failed to capitalize on the positive trend, as seen in HINDUNILVR's 2.68% return.
