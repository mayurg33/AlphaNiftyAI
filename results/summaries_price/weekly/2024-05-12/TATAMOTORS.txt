TATAMOTORS had a strong weekly performance, returning 3.0% and outperforming its peers, with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.32 indicating a relatively good risk-adjusted return. The stock's volatility was high at 37.24%, which is a concern, and the Max Drawdown of -2.72% suggests some turbulence during the week. Compared to its peers, TATAMOTORS outperformed TATASTEEL and TATACONSUM, but was slightly behind MARUTI. Overall, the stock's performance was promising, but its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment.
