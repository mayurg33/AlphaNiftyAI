BAJAJFINSV's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -2.4%, outperforming only SHRIRAMFIN among its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively moderate at 20.91%, lower than BAJFINANCE and BAJAJ-AUTO. However, its Sharpe Ratio of -0.45 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, but its relatively lower volatility made it a slightly more attractive option.
