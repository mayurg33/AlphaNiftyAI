JSWSTEEL's weekly return of 1.35% was modest, but its volatility of 30.87% indicates a relatively turbulent ride for investors. While it underperformed TATASTEEL and ULTRACEMCO in terms of returns, it outperformed BAJAJ-AUTO. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.18 suggests that the return was not particularly impressive given the level of risk taken. Overall, JSWSTEEL's performance was mediocre, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment this week.
