DRREDDY's weekly return of 1.59% was modest, but its volatility of 13.27% was relatively low compared to its peers. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly SUNPHARMA and DIVISLAB, which saw higher returns. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.48 suggests that the return was somewhat justified by the level of risk taken. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, but its relatively low volatility made it a less risky bet this week.
