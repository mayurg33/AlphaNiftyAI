LT's weekly performance was modest, with a 0.78% return, but its high volatility of 41.57% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, LT underperformed RELIANCE and ULTRACEMCO, but outperformed ONGC in terms of return. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.08 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return, and its Max Drawdown of -3.62% suggests a moderate level of risk. Overall, LT's weekly performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a risky bet.
