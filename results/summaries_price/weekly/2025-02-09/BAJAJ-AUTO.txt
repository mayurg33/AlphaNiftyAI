BAJAJ-AUTO's weekly performance was modest, with a 0.7% return, outperforming MARUTI but underperforming BAJFINANCE. The stock's volatility was relatively high at 16.85%, exceeding that of its peers. Despite this, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.17 suggests that the return was somewhat justified by the risk taken. Overall, the stock's performance was decent, but its high volatility and max drawdown of -0.91% indicate a relatively risky investment this week.
