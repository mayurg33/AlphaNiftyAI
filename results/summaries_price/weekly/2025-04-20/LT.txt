LT's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -0.32%, underperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively moderate at 17.12%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -0.14 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, LT lagged behind, with RELIANCE, ULTRACEMCO, and ONGC all posting positive returns. The stock's Max Drawdown of -0.92% suggests that it was a relatively risky investment this week.
