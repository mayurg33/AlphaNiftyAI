INDUSINDBK had a strong weekly performance, with a return of 7.99%, outperforming most of its peers, including ICICIBANK and SBIN. However, its high volatility of 70.67% suggests that the stock was quite risky this week. In comparison, AXISBANK had a similar return but with significantly lower volatility. Overall, INDUSINDBK's performance was impressive, but investors should be cautious of its high volatility.
