HEROMOTOCO's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -0.84%, underperforming its peers MARUTI and BAJAJ-AUTO. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 3.49%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -1.92 indicates poor risk-adjusted returns. Despite the low volatility, the stock's max drawdown of -0.84% suggests it was still a risky investment this week.
