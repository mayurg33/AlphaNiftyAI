INFY's weekly return of 2.01% was moderate, but its high volatility of 37.25% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, INFY underperformed TCS but outperformed ITC and WIPRO in terms of returns. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.22 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return, and its Max Drawdown of -1.94% suggests a moderate level of risk. Overall, INFY's performance was mediocre, with high volatility making it a relatively risky bet this week.
