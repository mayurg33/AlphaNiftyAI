LTIM's weekly return of 4.67% was a respectable performance, but its high volatility of 41.45% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. While it outperformed TITAN and ITC, it lagged behind TECHM's impressive 6.44% return. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.45 indicates a moderate risk-adjusted return, and its Max Drawdown of -0.85% suggests a relatively high risk profile. Overall, LTIM's performance was decent but came with significant volatility.
