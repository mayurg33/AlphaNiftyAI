HINDALCO's weekly return of 4.97% outperformed its peers, with a notable lead over ITC and ULTRACEMCO. However, this strong performance came with high volatility, making it a riskier investment. Compared to its peers, HINDALCO's Sharpe Ratio of 0.58 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Despite this, the stock's Max Drawdown of -1.09% suggests a moderate level of risk.
