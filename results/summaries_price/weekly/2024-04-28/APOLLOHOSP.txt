APOLLOHOSP's weekly return of 0.32% was relatively modest, accompanied by high volatility of 27.39%. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly DRREDDY, which saw a significant return of 3.92%. Despite this, APOLLOHOSP's Sharpe Ratio of 0.05 suggests that its return was not entirely justified by its risk-taking. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment this week.
