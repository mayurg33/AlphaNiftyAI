APOLLOHOSP's weekly return of 0.54% was modest, but its high volatility of 38.74% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, APOLLOHOSP underperformed DRREDDY but outperformed none of the top performers, HDFCLIFE and BHARTIARTL. With a Sharpe Ratio of 0.12, the stock's return was not adequately compensated for its risk, and its Max Drawdown of -1.44% indicates a notable decline. Overall, APOLLOHOSP was a relatively risky investment this week.
