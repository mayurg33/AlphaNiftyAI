BAJAJ-AUTO's weekly return of 2.09% was modest, but its high volatility of 27.06% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, BAJAJ-AUTO underperformed BAJFINANCE and MARUTI, but outperformed BAJAJFINSV. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.62 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Overall, BAJAJ-AUTO's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment this week.
