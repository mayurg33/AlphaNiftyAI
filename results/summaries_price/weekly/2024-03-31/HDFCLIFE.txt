HDFCLIFE's weekly return of 1.03% was modest, but its volatility of 13.53% was relatively high. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly HDFCBANK, which had a higher return with lower volatility. However, HDFCLIFE's Sharpe Ratio of 0.60 indicates that its return was somewhat justified by its risk-taking. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility made it a relatively risky investment this week.
