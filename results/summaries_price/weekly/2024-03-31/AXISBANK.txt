AXISBANK's weekly performance was lackluster, with a return of 0.64%, significantly underperforming its peers INDUSINDBK and ICICIBANK. The stock's volatility was high at 19.29%, which is concerning, especially when compared to INDUSINDBK's relatively low volatility of 3.26%. AXISBANK's Sharpe Ratio of 0.27 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Overall, the stock's performance was disappointing this week, and its high volatility makes it a risky investment.
