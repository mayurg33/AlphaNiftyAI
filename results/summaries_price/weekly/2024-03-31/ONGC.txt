ONGC's weekly return of 0.96% was modest, but its high volatility of 42.87% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, ONGC underperformed BPCL and significantly lagged behind LT and RELIANCE in terms of returns. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.18 indicates that the return was not entirely justified by the level of risk taken. Overall, ONGC's weekly performance was lackluster and relatively risky.
