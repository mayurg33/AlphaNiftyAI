Maruti's weekly return of 2.86% was a decent performance, albeit slightly lagging behind M&M's 3.08% return. The stock's volatility of 15.73% was relatively moderate compared to its peers, with TATAMOTORS and BAJAJ-AUTO exhibiting much higher volatility. Maruti's Sharpe Ratio of 1.43 indicates a relatively attractive risk-return profile. Overall, Maruti underperformed M&M but outperformed the other two peers, and its moderate volatility suggests a relatively stable performance this week.
