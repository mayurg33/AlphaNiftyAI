TITAN's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -3.43% and a maximum drawdown of the same magnitude, indicating a significant decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 5.56%, but its Sharpe ratio of -2.48 suggests that the return was not justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, TITAN underperformed, with only TATAMOTORS faring worse. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its poor performance outweighs this advantage.
