BAJAJ-AUTO's weekly return of 2.17% was modest, but its volatility of 24.93% was relatively high. The stock underperformed its peers, including BAJFINANCE and MARUTI, which posted higher returns. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.35 indicates that the return was somewhat justified by the level of risk taken. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility made it a relatively risky investment this week.
