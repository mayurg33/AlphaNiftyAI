INFY's weekly return of 3.76% was a respectable performance, but it underperformed its peers TCS and WIPRO. The stock's volatility of 36.56% was higher than its peers, indicating a riskier investment. Despite this, INFY's Sharpe Ratio of 0.41 suggests that its return was somewhat justified by its risk-taking. Overall, INFY's performance was decent but not outstanding, and its high volatility made it a relatively riskier bet this week.
