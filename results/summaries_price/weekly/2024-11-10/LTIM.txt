LTIM had a strong weekly performance, returning 3.31% and outperforming its peers TECHM, TITAN, and ITC. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.30 indicates a relatively good risk-adjusted return. However, its high volatility of 44.02% and max drawdown of -1.74% suggest that the stock was quite risky this week. Overall, LTIM's performance was impressive, but investors should be cautious of its high volatility.
