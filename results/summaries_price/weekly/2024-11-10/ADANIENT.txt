ADANIENT's weekly return of 1.09% was a relatively strong performance, outpacing peers ADANIPORTS and POWERGRID, but underperforming RELIANCE. The stock's high volatility of 48.73% indicates a risky investment environment, which is reflected in its low Sharpe Ratio of 0.10. Despite this, the stock's max drawdown of -3.85% suggests that it has been able to recover from recent losses.
