ONGC's weekly return of 1.12% was modest, but its high volatility of 22.39% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, ONGC underperformed BPCL and RELIANCE, but outperformed LT in terms of return. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.27 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Overall, ONGC was a relatively risky stock this week.
