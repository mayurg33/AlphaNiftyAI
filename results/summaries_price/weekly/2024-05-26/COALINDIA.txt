COALINDIA's weekly performance was strong, with a 2.11% return, outperforming its peers TATASTEEL and TATACONSUM. However, the stock's high volatility of 24.84% and max drawdown of -0.88% indicate a risky investment. In comparison, POWERGRID underperformed with a -2.1% return, but had lower volatility. COALINDIA's Sharpe Ratio of 0.45 suggests that its return was somewhat justified by its risk. Overall, the stock's performance was promising, but investors should be cautious of its high volatility.
