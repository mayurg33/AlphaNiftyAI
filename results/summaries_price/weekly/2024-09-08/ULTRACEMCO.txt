ULTRACEMCO's weekly return of 0.07% was modest, accompanied by relatively high volatility of 13.59%. While the stock's performance was lackluster, it outperformed LT but underperformed GRASIM and HEROMOTOCO. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.02 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken, and the Max Drawdown of -1.27% indicates a moderate level of risk.
