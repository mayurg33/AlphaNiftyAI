Maruti's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.94% and a max drawdown of -1.94%, indicating a decline in stock value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 4.8%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -1.61 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, Maruti outperformed M&M and TATAMOTORS but underperformed BAJAJ-AUTO. Overall, the stock was moderately risky this week.
