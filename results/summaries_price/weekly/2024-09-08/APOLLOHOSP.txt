APOLLOHOSP demonstrated a relatively strong weekly performance, returning 0.39% amidst a volatile market. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.12 suggests that its return was somewhat justified by its risk-taking. In comparison to its peers, APOLLOHOSP outperformed DRREDDY, HDFCLIFE, and BHARTIARTL, which all posted negative returns. However, the stock's Max Drawdown of -0.51% and Volatility of 12.84% indicate that it was still a relatively risky investment this week.
