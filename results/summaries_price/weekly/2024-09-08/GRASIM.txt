GRASIM's weekly performance was relatively stable, with a modest return of 0.08%, outperforming peers RELIANCE and BRITANNIA, but in line with ULTRACEMCO. However, the stock's high volatility of 24.89% and low Sharpe Ratio of 0.02 indicate a relatively risky investment. The Max Drawdown of -2.35% also suggests potential for significant losses.
