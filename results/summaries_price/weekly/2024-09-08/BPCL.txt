BPCL's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -1.76%, indicating a decline in stock value. The stock's volatility was high at 23.89%, suggesting significant price fluctuations. Despite this, BPCL outperformed its peers ONGC, SBIN, and RELIANCE in terms of returns. However, its Sharpe Ratio of -0.29 indicates that the stock's return was not sufficient to compensate for its high volatility, making it a relatively risky investment this week.
