HDFCLIFE had a disappointing week, with a -0.93% return, underperforming its peers. The stock's high volatility of 24.41% contributed to its poor performance, making it a risky investment this week. In comparison, HDFCBANK and SBILIFE had positive returns, while HINDUNILVR outperformed the pack with a 1.79% return. Overall, HDFCLIFE's weak performance and high volatility make it an unattractive option for investors.
