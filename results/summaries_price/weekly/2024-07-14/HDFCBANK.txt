HDFCBANK's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -0.77%, underperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 5.25%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -0.59 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, HDFCBANK underperformed HDFCLIFE and SBIN, but outperformed ICICIBANK. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its negative return and low Sharpe Ratio make it an unattractive investment option.
