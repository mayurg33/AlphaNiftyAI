Here is the summary:

NESTLEIND's weekly return of 0.65% was relatively modest, but its high volatility of 13.67% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, NESTLEIND underperformed HINDUNILVR but outperformed TATACONSUM, while being significantly more volatile than both. BRITANNIA was the clear outperformer this week. With a Sharpe Ratio of 0.25, the stock's return was not adequately compensated for its risk.
