INDUSINDBK's weekly return of 0.81% was modest, but its high volatility of 28.39% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, INDUSINDBK underperformed ICICIBANK but outperformed AXISBANK and SBIN. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.16 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return, while its Max Drawdown of -1.45% suggests some resilience. Overall, INDUSINDBK's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky bet.
