SHRIRAMFIN's weekly return of 0.55% was modest, but its high volatility of 19.86% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly M&M, which saw a significant return of 4.82%. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.15 indicates that the stock's return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, SHRIRAMFIN's performance was lackluster this week, with a relatively high level of risk.
