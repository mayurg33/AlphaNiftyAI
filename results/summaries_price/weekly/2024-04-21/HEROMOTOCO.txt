HEROMOTOCO's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -3.82% and a max drawdown of the same magnitude, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 6.15%, but its Sharpe ratio of -3.33 suggests that the return was not justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, HEROMOTOCO underperformed MARUTI and M&M, but outperformed BAJAJ-AUTO. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its poor performance outweighed this advantage.
