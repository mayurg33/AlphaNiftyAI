SUNPHARMA's weekly return of 1.53% was a moderate outperformance compared to its peers, with a higher return than DIVISLAB and DRREDDY, but lower than HINDUNILVR. However, its volatility of 22.21% was relatively high, indicating a riskier investment. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.28 suggests that the return was not entirely justified by the level of risk taken. Overall, SUNPHARMA's performance was decent, but its high volatility and moderate Sharpe Ratio make it a relatively riskier stock this week.
