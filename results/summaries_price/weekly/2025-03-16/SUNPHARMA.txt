SUNPHARMA had a strong weekly performance, with a return of 4.46%, outperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively high at 18.6%, but its Sharpe Ratio of 1.26 indicates that the returns were sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. In comparison, SUNPHARMA outperformed DRREDDY and HINDUNILVR, but was only slightly ahead of DIVISLAB. Overall, the stock's performance was impressive, but investors should be aware of the elevated risk.
