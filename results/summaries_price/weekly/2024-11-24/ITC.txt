ITC's weekly performance was decent, with a return of 1.74%, but its high volatility of 48.08% suggests a bumpy ride for investors. Compared to its peers, ITC underperformed ICICIBANK but outperformed RELIANCE and HINDUNILVR in terms of returns. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.20 indicates that its return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, ITC's high volatility and moderate return make it a relatively risky investment this week.
