BAJFINANCE had a positive weekly return of 1.77%, outperforming its peers BAJAJFINSV and BAJAJ-AUTO, but underperforming AXISBANK. Despite the positive return, the stock's high volatility of 42.48% and low Sharpe Ratio of 0.23 indicate a risky investment. The stock's max drawdown of -1.97% also suggests potential for significant losses.
