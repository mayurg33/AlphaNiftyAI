ITC's weekly return of 5.1% outperformed its peers, with a notable lead over ICICIBANK and RELIANCE. However, its high volatility of 30.39% indicates a riskier investment compared to its peers. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.53 suggests that the return was not entirely justified by the level of risk taken. Despite this, ITC's performance was strong, with a maximum drawdown of -1.53% indicating a relatively stable week.
