TECHM had a disappointing week, with a -2.14% return, underperforming its peers. The stock's high volatility of 27.91% contributed to its poor performance, making it a risky investment this week. In comparison, peers such as M&M, KOTAKBANK, and TCS all posted positive returns, with KOTAKBANK being the top performer. Overall, TECHM's negative return and high volatility make it an unattractive option for investors.
