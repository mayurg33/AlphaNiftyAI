Britannia's weekly return of 2.98% was modest, but its volatility of 21.17% was relatively high. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly NESTLEIND, which had a higher return and lower volatility. Britannia's Sharpe Ratio of 0.56 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility made it a riskier investment this week.
