HEROMOTOCO's weekly performance was modest, with a return of 2.85%, but its volatility was relatively high at 31.36%. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly MARUTI and BAJAJ-AUTO, which had higher returns. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.36 indicates that the return was somewhat justified by the level of risk taken. Overall, the stock's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment this week.
