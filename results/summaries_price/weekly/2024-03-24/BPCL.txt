BPCL's weekly return of 1.8% was a moderate performance, but its high volatility of 53.53% indicates a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, BPCL underperformed ONGC and RELIANCE but outperformed SBIN in terms of returns. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.15 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the high risk taken. The stock's Max Drawdown of -4.22% further highlights its riskiness.
