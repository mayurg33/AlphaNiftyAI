Maruti's weekly return of -3.45% was a disappointing performance, accompanied by relatively low volatility of 15.39%. Despite this, the stock's Sharpe Ratio of -1.20 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, Maruti outperformed M&M and BAJAJ-AUTO but underperformed TATAMOTORS. Overall, the stock's risk profile was relatively moderate this week.
