HEROMOTOCO's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -3.23%, slightly outperforming its peers MARUTI, M&M, and BAJAJ-AUTO. However, its high volatility of 49.44% and negative Sharpe Ratio of -0.34 indicate a risky investment. Despite the relatively better return, the stock's high volatility and max drawdown of -5.0% make it a concerning investment option. Overall, HEROMOTOCO underperformed in terms of risk-adjusted returns.
