INFY's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -5.6%, significantly underperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was moderate at 18.66%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -1.21 indicates that the return was not justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, INFY underperformed TCS and WIPRO, but fared worse than ITC, which posted a positive return. Overall, INFY was a relatively risky investment this week.
