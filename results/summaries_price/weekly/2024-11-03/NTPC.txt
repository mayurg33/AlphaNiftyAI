NTPC's weekly return of 1.84% was moderate, but its high volatility of 19.91% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, NTPC underperformed POWERGRID but outperformed COALINDIA and ONGC in terms of return. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.37 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Overall, NTPC was a relatively risky stock this week.
