LT had a stellar weekly performance, returning 8.55% and outperforming its peers. The stock's high volatility of 44.78% indicates a risky investment, but its Sharpe Ratio of 0.74 suggests that the returns were somewhat justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, LT significantly outperformed RELIANCE and ULTRACEMCO, and even surpassed ONGC's return. Overall, LT's high returns came with high risk, but its performance was impressive nonetheless.
