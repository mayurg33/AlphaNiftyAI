HCLTECH's weekly return of 0.53% was modest, but its volatility of 32.01% indicates a relatively turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, HCLTECH underperformed HDFCLIFE but outperformed TECHM and HINDALCO. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.07 suggests that its return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, HCLTECH's weekly performance was lackluster, and its high volatility made it a relatively risky investment this week.
