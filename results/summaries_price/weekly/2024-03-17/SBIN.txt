SBIN's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -5.4% and a max drawdown of -5.4%, indicating a significant decline in value. The stock's volatility was moderate at 6.95%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -3.15 suggests that the return was not justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, SBIN underperformed ICICIBANK and HDFCBANK, but was in line with AXISBANK's poor performance. Overall, SBIN was a relatively risky investment this week.
