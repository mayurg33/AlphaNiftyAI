ITC's weekly return of 2.37% outperformed its peers, with a notable gain amidst a volatile market. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.24 indicates a relatively attractive risk-adjusted return. Compared to its peers, ITC's performance was impressive, with ICICIBANK and HINDUNILVR struggling with negative returns. However, the stock's high volatility of 41.22% and max drawdown of -1.21% suggest a risky investment this week.
