HINDALCO's weekly return of -0.99% was relatively better than its peers ITC and ULTRACEMCO, but underperformed HCLTECH. The stock's high volatility of 27.03% and negative Sharpe ratio of -0.14 indicate a risky investment this week. Despite the relatively better return, the stock's max drawdown of -2.53% suggests a significant decline in value. Overall, HINDALCO's performance was mediocre, with high risk and volatility.
