EICHERMOT's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -4.06% and a max drawdown of the same magnitude, indicating a significant decline in value. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 10.14%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -1.61 suggests that the return was not justified by the level of risk taken. Compared to its peers, EICHERMOT underperformed, with only BAJAJ-AUTO posting a similar return. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its poor performance outweighs this advantage.
