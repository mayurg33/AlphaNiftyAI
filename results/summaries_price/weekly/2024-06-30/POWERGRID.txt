POWERGRID's weekly performance was lackluster, with a -0.6% return, underperforming its peers COALINDIA and ITC. The stock's high volatility of 20.45% was only surpassed by NTPC, indicating a relatively risky investment environment. Despite this, POWERGRID's Sharpe Ratio of -0.11 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Overall, the stock's performance was disappointing, and investors may want to exercise caution.
