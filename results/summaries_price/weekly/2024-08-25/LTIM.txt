LTIM's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -0.61%, underperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 11.11%, but its Sharpe ratio of -0.22 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, LTIM lagged behind, with TECHM and ITC posting positive returns, and TITAN outperforming with a 3.03% return. Overall, LTIM was a relatively low-risk stock this week, but its poor performance makes it a less attractive option.
