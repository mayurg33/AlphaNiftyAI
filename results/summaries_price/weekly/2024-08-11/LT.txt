LT's weekly return of 1.82% was modest, but its high volatility of 29.85% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, LT underperformed RELIANCE and ONGC, but outperformed ULTRACEMCO. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.25 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return. Overall, LT's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment option this week.
