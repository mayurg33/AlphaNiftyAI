JSWSTEEL had a strong weekly performance, with a return of 4.78%, outperforming its peers. The stock's volatility was relatively high at 34.88%, but its Sharpe Ratio of 0.54 indicates that the returns were somewhat justified by the risk taken. Compared to its peers, JSWSTEEL outperformed TATASTEEL and BAJAJ-AUTO, and significantly outperformed ULTRACEMCO. However, the stock's max drawdown of -2.09% suggests that it was a relatively risky investment this week.
