TECHM's weekly return of 1.04% was modest, but its high volatility of 15.41% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, TECHM underperformed M&M and TCS in terms of return, but outperformed KOTAKBANK. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.27 indicates that its return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, TECHM was a relatively risky bet this week.
