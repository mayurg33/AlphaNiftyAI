ASIANPAINT's weekly return of 0.66% was modest, but its high volatility of 16.41% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, ASIANPAINT underperformed M&M but outperformed MARUTI, while SUNPHARMA's return was closer to its own. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.16 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return, and its Max Drawdown of -1.15% suggests a moderate level of risk. Overall, ASIANPAINT's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment option.
