SHRIRAMFIN's weekly return of 1.79% was modest, but its high volatility of 37.11% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. The stock underperformed its peers, particularly BAJFINANCE, which posted a return of 4.58%. Despite a relatively low Sharpe Ratio of 0.20, the stock's max drawdown of -2.64% indicates a moderate level of risk. Overall, SHRIRAMFIN's performance was lackluster this week.
