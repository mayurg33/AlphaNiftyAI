LTIM's weekly return of 4.39% was respectable, but its high volatility of 26.41% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. While it outperformed ITC and TITAN, it lagged behind TECHM's impressive 4.87% return. With a Sharpe Ratio of 0.65, LTIM's risk-adjusted performance was mediocre, indicating that the stock's returns were not entirely justified by its high level of risk.
