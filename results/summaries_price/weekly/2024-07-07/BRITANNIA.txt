Britannia's weekly return of 1.28% was a decent performance, but its high volatility of 24.8% suggests a bumpy ride for investors. Compared to its peers, Britannia underperformed RELIANCE but outperformed NESTLEIND and GRASIM in terms of returns. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.21 indicates a relatively low risk-adjusted return, and its Max Drawdown of -1.37% suggests some resilience in the face of market downturns. Overall, Britannia's performance was mediocre, but its high volatility makes it a relatively riskier bet.
