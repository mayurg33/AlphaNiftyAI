INDUSINDBK had a strong weekly performance, returning 2.11% and outperforming its peers ICICIBANK and AXISBANK. Although its volatility was high at 35.94%, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.24 indicates that the return was somewhat justified by the risk taken. In comparison, SBIN had a similar return but with lower volatility, making it a relatively more attractive option. Overall, INDUSINDBK's performance was decent, but its high volatility makes it a riskier investment.
