TATACONSUM posted a modest weekly return of 0.31%, outperforming its peers TATAMOTORS and TCS, but underperforming TATASTEEL. Despite the positive return, the stock's volatility was relatively high at 26.23%, indicating a risky investment environment. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.05 suggests that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken. Overall, TATACONSUM's weekly performance was decent, but investors should be cautious due to the high volatility.
