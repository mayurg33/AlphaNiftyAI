GRASIM's weekly return of 1.61% was modest, but its volatility of 19.0% indicates a relatively turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, GRASIM underperformed RELIANCE and ULTRACEMCO, but outperformed BRITANNIA. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.34 suggests that its return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, GRASIM's performance was lackluster, and its high volatility made it a relatively risky investment this week.
