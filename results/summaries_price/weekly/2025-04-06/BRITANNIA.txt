Britannia's weekly return of 2.5% outperformed its peers, with a relatively high Sharpe Ratio of 0.44, indicating a decent risk-adjusted performance. The stock's volatility of 30.0% was higher than most of its peers, except for Reliance. Despite this, Britannia's performance was better than its peers, with NESTLEIND being the closest competitor. However, the stock's Max Drawdown of -0.99% suggests that it was still a relatively risky investment this week.
