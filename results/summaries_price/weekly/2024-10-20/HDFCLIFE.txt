HDFCLIFE had a relatively positive week, with a 0.25% return, outperforming its peers HDFCBANK, SBILIFE, and HINDUNILVR. However, its high volatility of 41.79% suggests a risky investment environment. Despite the positive return, the Sharpe Ratio of 0.03 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -3.56% also highlights the potential for significant losses.
