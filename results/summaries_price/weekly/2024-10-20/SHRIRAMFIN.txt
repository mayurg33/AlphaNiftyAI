SHRIRAMFIN's weekly return of -1.49% was relatively better than its peers, with a lower decline compared to BAJFINANCE and M&M. However, its high volatility of 42.73% and negative Sharpe Ratio of -0.13 indicate a risky investment this week. Despite this, SHRIRAMFIN outperformed its peers in terms of return, but its max drawdown of -4.19% suggests a significant decline in value. Overall, SHRIRAMFIN's performance was relatively better than its peers, but its high volatility makes it a risky investment.
