HDFCBANK's weekly return of 2.05% was modest, but its high volatility of 25.92% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, HDFCBANK underperformed HDFCLIFE and SBIN, but outperformed ICICIBANK. With a Sharpe Ratio of 0.32, the stock's return was not adequately compensated for its risk, and the Max Drawdown of -1.08% indicates a notable decline during the week. Overall, HDFCBANK's performance was lackluster and relatively risky.
