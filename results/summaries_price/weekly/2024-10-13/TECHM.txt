TECHM's weekly return of 1.76% was modest, but its volatility of 30.86% suggests a relatively turbulent ride for investors. While it outperformed TCS, it underperformed M&M and KOTAKBANK in terms of returns. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.23 indicates that the stock's return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, TECHM's performance was mediocre, and its high volatility makes it a relatively risky investment option this week.
