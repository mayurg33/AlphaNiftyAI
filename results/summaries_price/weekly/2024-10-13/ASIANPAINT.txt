ASIANPAINT's weekly performance was disappointing, with a return of -0.82%, underperforming its peers M&M and MARUTI. The stock's volatility was relatively low at 11.44%, but its Sharpe Ratio of -0.28 indicates that the return was not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. Compared to its peers, ASIANPAINT was one of the worst performers this week, with only SUNPHARMA posting a similar negative return. Overall, the stock was relatively less risky this week, but its poor performance outweighs this benefit.
