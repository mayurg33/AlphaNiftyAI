BAJFINANCE underperformed this week, with a -2.47% return, outpacing only BAJAJ-AUTO among its peers. The stock's high volatility of 62.45% contributed to its poor performance, with a Sharpe Ratio of -0.20 indicating a poor risk-return tradeoff. Despite a relatively better return compared to BAJAJFINSV, BAJFINANCE's high volatility and max drawdown of -5.04% make it a risky investment this week.
