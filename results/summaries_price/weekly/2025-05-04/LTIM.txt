LTIM's weekly return of 1.92% was respectable, but its high volatility of 25.27% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. While it outperformed TITAN and ITC, it lagged behind TECHM's 2.23% return. The stock's Sharpe Ratio of 0.40 indicates a moderate risk-adjusted performance. Overall, LTIM's weekly performance was decent, but its high volatility makes it a relatively riskier bet.
