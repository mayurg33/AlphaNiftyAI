ITC's weekly return of 0.22% was a relatively strong performance, especially compared to its peers ICICIBANK, RELIANCE, and HINDUNILVR, which all posted negative or lower returns. However, the stock's high volatility of 26.65% and low Sharpe Ratio of 0.04 suggest that the returns came with significant risk. Despite this, ITC outperformed its peers this week, but investors should be cautious of the stock's high risk profile.
