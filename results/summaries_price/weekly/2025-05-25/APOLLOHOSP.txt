APOLLOHOSP's weekly return of 1.29% was modest, but its high volatility of 18.65% suggests a turbulent ride for investors. Compared to its peers, APOLLOHOSP underperformed DRREDDY and BHARTIARTL, but outperformed HDFCLIFE in terms of return. However, its Sharpe Ratio of 0.28 indicates that the return was not adequately compensated for the level of risk taken. Overall, APOLLOHOSP was a relatively risky stock this week.
