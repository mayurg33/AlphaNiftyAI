**Summary:**

Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HINDUNILVR) has underperformed in the recent past, with a 12-month return of -13.53%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.235, and its Sharpe Ratio is a poor -7.274, indicating that the returns are not justified by the risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.143, which is a significant decline. In terms of peer correlation, HINDUNILVR has a low correlation with RELIANCE, a moderate correlation with TATACONSUM, and a high correlation with NESTLEIND.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the current performance and metrics, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for HINDUNILVR. The stock's poor returns, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with NESTLEIND may suggest that the stock is closely tied to the performance of its peer, which could limit its potential for outperformance. However, it's essential to conduct further analysis and consider other factors before making a final investment decision.
