--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO's stock has been underperforming, with a 12-month return of -6.52% and a Sharpe Ratio of -3.72, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.211. Correlation analysis reveals that ULTRACEMCO has a significant positive correlation with GRASIM (0.5784) but low correlations with HEROMOTOCO and LT. The average peer correlation is 0.2613.

**Recommendation:**

Considering the stock's poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's negative returns over various time horizons suggest a downward trend, and the high volatility indicates a high risk of further losses. The low Sharpe Ratio implies that the stock is not generating sufficient returns to justify the level of risk taken. Additionally, the moderate correlation with GRASIM may not provide sufficient diversification benefits to offset the stock's poor performance. It may be wise to reallocate funds to more promising investment opportunities.
