**Summary:**

Infosys (INFY) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a negative return of 6.67%. The stock has been volatile, with a standard deviation of 0.254, and a Sharpe ratio of -3.141, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of 9.7% suggests that the stock has experienced significant price drops in the past. In terms of peer correlation, INFY has a moderate correlation with TCS (0.2453), but low correlation with ITC (0.0254) and a negative correlation with WIPRO (-0.0484).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance and high volatility, I would recommend a **SELL** on INFY. The negative returns over various time periods, combined with a low Sharpe ratio, suggest that the stock is not providing adequate returns for the level of risk taken. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant price drops, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlation with TCS is moderate, it is not sufficient to justify holding onto the stock given its overall poor performance.
