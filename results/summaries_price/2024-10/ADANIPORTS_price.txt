**Summary:**

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (ADANIPORTS) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -6.24%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.318, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.274, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is -10.1%, which is a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis shows that ADANIPORTS has a strong positive correlation with Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT) at 0.8345, moderate correlation with State Bank of India (SBIN) at 0.5792, and a weak correlation with Maruti Suzuki (MARUTI) at 0.2267.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** rating for ADANIPORTS. The stock's poor performance over the last 12 months, combined with its high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns, indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlation with ADANIENT, which may be a concern due to the group's exposure to various sectors, further supports the sell recommendation. Investors may consider diversifying their portfolio by reducing exposure to ADANIPORTS and exploring other investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
