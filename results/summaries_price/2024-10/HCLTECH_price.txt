**Summary:**

HCLTECH has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past 12 months, with a return of -2.14%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.204, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.173, indicating that the return is not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The max drawdown is relatively low at -0.056. In terms of peer correlation, HCLTECH has a moderate correlation with TECHM (0.6729) and relatively low correlations with HDFCLIFE (0.2321) and HINDALCO (0.2246).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for HCLTECH. The stock's decline in price and negative returns over the past 12 months are concerning, but the moderate volatility and relatively low max drawdown suggest that the stock may not be oversold. Additionally, the peer correlations indicate that HCLTECH is not highly correlated with its peers, which could make it a more attractive option for diversification purposes. However, I would not recommend a BUY at this time, as the stock's performance has been lackluster. Further analysis and monitoring of the stock's fundamentals and market trends are necessary to determine if the stock will recover or continue to decline.
