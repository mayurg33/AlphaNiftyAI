Here is a short summary and recommendation based on the provided data:

**Summary:**
Grasim Industries Ltd. (GRASIM) has been experiencing a decline in its stock price over the past year, with a 12-month return of -3.76%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.200, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.204, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The maximum drawdown is -0.066, suggesting some degree of stability. In terms of peer correlation, GRASIM has a moderate correlation with RELIANCE (0.4301) and a strong correlation with ULTRACEMCO (0.5784), but a relatively low correlation with BRITANNIA (0.0956).

**Recommendation:**
Based on the data, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on GRASIM. The stock's poor performance over the past year, coupled with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, does not make it an attractive buy at this time. However, the moderate correlation with its peers and relatively low maximum drawdown suggest that the stock may not be a strong sell candidate either. Investors may want to wait for a more favorable entry point or a turnaround in the company's fundamentals before considering a buy.
