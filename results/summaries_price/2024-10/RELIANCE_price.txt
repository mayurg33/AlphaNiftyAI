**Summary:**

Reliance Industries Ltd. (RELIANCE) has exhibited poor performance over the past 12 months, with a return of -9.06%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.203, and its Sharpe Ratio is -5.513, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.094, which is relatively high. In terms of peer correlation, RELIANCE has a moderate correlation with its peers, with an average correlation of 0.3372.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** on RELIANCE. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant losses, which could be a concern for investors. While the peer correlation is moderate, it is not strong enough to suggest that RELIANCE will follow the performance of its peers. Overall, I believe that there may be better investment opportunities available in the market.
