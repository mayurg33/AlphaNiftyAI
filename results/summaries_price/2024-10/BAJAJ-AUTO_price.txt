**Summary:**

BAJAJ-AUTO's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -19.09%, indicating a significant decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.521, and its Sharpe Ratio is a negative 4.590, suggesting that the returns have not justified the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.191 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline from its peak. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a moderate correlation with MARUTI (0.4174) and relatively low correlations with BAJFINANCE (0.1331) and BAJAJFINSV (0.1182).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that the risks associated with holding this stock outweigh the potential benefits. Additionally, the Max Drawdown indicates that the stock has already experienced a significant decline, and it may take some time for it to recover. Given the lack of strong positive correlations with peers, it's difficult to argue that the stock is undervalued or has strong growth potential. Therefore, it's advisable to sell BAJAJ-AUTO and consider alternative investment opportunities.
