**Summary:**

CIPLA's stock performance has been disappointing over the past 12 months, with a return of -6.79%. The volatility of the stock is moderate at 0.425, and the Sharpe Ratio is -1.785, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.156 is also a concern. However, the correlation with its peers is relatively low, suggesting that CIPLA's performance is not strongly linked to the broader pharmaceutical industry.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance and high volatility, I would recommend a **SELL** position on CIPLA. The low Sharpe Ratio and high maximum drawdown indicate that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the low correlation with peers suggests that CIPLA's underperformance is not just a sector-wide issue, but rather a company-specific problem. It may be wise to reassess the stock's fundamentals and wait for a turnaround before considering a BUY or HOLD position.
