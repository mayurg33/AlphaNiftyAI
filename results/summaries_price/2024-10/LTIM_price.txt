--- LLM Output ---
Here is a short summary and recommendation based on the provided data:

**Summary:**
LTIM has been underperforming in the recent past, with a 12-month return of -8.66%, indicating a decline in its stock price. The volatility of the stock is moderate at 0.282, and the Sharpe ratio is negative, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The stock has a maximum drawdown of 11.3%, indicating a significant decline in its value. In terms of peer correlation, LTIM has a moderate positive correlation with TECHM, a weak positive correlation with ITC, and a weak negative correlation with TITAN.

**Recommendation:**
Based on the data, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's underperformance in the recent past, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe ratio, indicates that the risk is not being rewarded with adequate returns. Additionally, the maximum drawdown of 11.3% suggests that the stock is prone to significant declines, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlations are not extremely concerning, they do not provide a compelling reason to hold or buy the stock.
