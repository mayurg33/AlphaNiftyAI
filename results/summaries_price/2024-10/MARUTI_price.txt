**Summary:**

Maruti's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -15.87%, indicating a significant decline in value. The volatility of the stock is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.252. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.161 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in the past. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a moderate to high correlation with TATAMOTORS and BAJAJ-AUTO, but a relatively low correlation with M&M.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that the risk is not justified by the potential returns. Additionally, the high correlation with peers suggests that the stock is likely to continue to move in tandem with the broader automotive sector, which may not be favorable in the current market conditions. It may be wise to reconsider the investment in Maruti and explore other opportunities with more promising returns and lower risk profiles.
