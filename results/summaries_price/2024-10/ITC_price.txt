**Summary:**

ITC's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -5.31%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.198, and the Sharpe Ratio is -3.208, suggesting that the returns have not justified the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.086 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year. In terms of peer correlation, ITC has a moderate correlation with HINDUNILVR (0.5496) and a low correlation with ICICIBANK (0.2374) and RELIANCE (0.1078).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on ITC. The stock's poor performance and high volatility are concerns, but the moderate correlation with HINDUNILVR suggests that it may still have some upside potential. Additionally, the low correlation with ICICIBANK and RELIANCE indicates that ITC may not be heavily influenced by broader market trends. However, the negative Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown suggest that the stock is not a compelling buy at this time. It may be wise to monitor the stock's performance and wait for a clearer trend to emerge before making a buy or sell decision.
