The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.220, and its Sharpe Ratio is -6.260, suggesting that the returns have not justified the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.127 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant price drop in the past.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the strong correlation with JSWSTEEL suggests that the stock may be heavily influenced by the steel industry's performance, which may continue to be a challenge. It may be wise to reconsider the investment or explore alternative opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
