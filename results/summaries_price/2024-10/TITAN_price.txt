**Summary:**

Titan Company Limited (TITAN) has experienced a decline in its stock price, with a 12-month return of -13.48%. The stock's volatility is relatively high at 0.189, and its Sharpe Ratio is -9.074, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is -0.135, suggesting a significant decline in the stock's value. The average peer correlation is 0.3878, indicating a moderate correlation with its peers in the Tata group.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position for Titan Company Limited (TITAN). The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that the stock is not a attractive investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers in the Tata group may indicate that the stock is closely tied to the performance of the group as a whole, which may not be favorable in the current market conditions. It may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
