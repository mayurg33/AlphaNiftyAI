Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a SELL on Tata Motors (TATAMOTORS). The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers, particularly Maruti, may indicate that the stock is heavily influenced by industry trends, which could further exacerbate its decline.
