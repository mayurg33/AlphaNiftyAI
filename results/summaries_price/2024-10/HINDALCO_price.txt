**Summary:**

Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HINDALCO) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past 12 months, with a return of -9.91%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.265. The Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return, is -4.581, indicating that the stock's return is not sufficient to compensate for its risk. The maximum drawdown, or the largest peak-to-trough decline, is -0.109. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a mix of positive and negative correlations, with an average peer correlation of -0.008.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on HINDALCO. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the lack of strong positive correlations with peers suggests that the stock may not benefit from industry trends. Overall, the risks associated with HINDALCO outweigh its potential benefits, making it a sell candidate.
