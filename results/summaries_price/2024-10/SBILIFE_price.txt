Here is a short summary and recommendation based on the provided data:

**Summary:**

SBI Life Insurance (SBILIFE) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past 12 months, with a return of -11.56%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.263. The Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is -5.468, indicating that the stock's return is not sufficient to compensate for its risk. The maximum drawdown, or peak-to-trough decline, is 12.4%. In terms of peer correlation, SBILIFE has a moderate correlation with HDFCLIFE (0.5315) and a low correlation with SBIN (0.3012) and INDUSINDBK (-0.032).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance of SBILIFE over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's decline in value and lack of returns over the past year suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high volatility and maximum drawdown indicate that the stock is subject to significant price fluctuations, which may be a concern for risk-averse investors.
