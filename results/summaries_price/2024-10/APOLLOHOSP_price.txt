**Summary:**
Apollo Hospitals (APOLLOHOSP) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -1.83%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.199, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.015, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is 5.3%, suggesting some downside risk. The stock has low correlations with its peers DRREDDY and HDFCLIFE, but a relatively high correlation with BHARTIARTL. 

**Recommendation:**
Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for Apollo Hospitals (APOLLOHOSP). The stock's underperformance and poor risk-adjusted returns are concerns, but the moderate volatility and relatively low maximum drawdown suggest that the stock may not be overly risky. Additionally, the low correlations with some peers could indicate that the stock's performance is not closely tied to the broader industry trends. However, I would not recommend a BUY at this point, as the stock's performance does not suggest a strong upward trend. A SELL rating is also not warranted, as the stock's fundamentals do not indicate a significant decline in value. A HOLD rating allows investors to monitor the stock's performance and wait for a potential turnaround or improvement in its fundamentals.
