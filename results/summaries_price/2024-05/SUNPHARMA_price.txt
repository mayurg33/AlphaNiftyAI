**Summary:**

Sun Pharma's stock has been underperforming, with a 12-month return of -3.90% and a Sharpe Ratio of -2.695, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.180, and it has experienced a maximum drawdown of 5.6%. Correlation analysis with peers reveals a mixed picture, with a relatively high correlation with DivisLab (0.2349) and a negative correlation with Hindunilvr (-0.0369).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for Sun Pharma. The stock's underperformance and poor risk-adjusted returns are concerns, but the moderate volatility and mixed correlation with peers suggest that it may not be the right time to sell. Instead, investors may want to wait for a clearer trend or a more attractive entry point to consider buying or selling the stock. Additionally, it may be worth monitoring the company's fundamentals and industry trends to identify potential catalysts for a turnaround.
