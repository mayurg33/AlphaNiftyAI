**Summary:**

HCLTECH's stock performance has been disappointing over the past 12 months, with a return of -1.38%. The stock has also been consistently declining over the shorter terms of 6 months and 3 months, indicating a persistent downward trend. The volatility of the stock is moderate at 0.129, and the Sharpe Ratio is negative, suggesting that the risk-adjusted return is not attractive. The Max Drawdown is relatively low at -0.025, indicating that the stock has not experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlations, HCLTECH has a moderate correlation with TECHM (0.5597) and a low correlation with HDFCLIFE (0.2156) and HINDALCO (0.1036).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The consistent decline in stock price over various time periods, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio, suggests that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the moderate correlation with TECHM may indicate that the stock is influenced by similar market factors, which could lead to further decline. While the Max Drawdown is relatively low, it does not outweigh the other negative indicators. It may be wise to reconsider the investment in HCLTECH and explore alternative options with better growth prospects.
