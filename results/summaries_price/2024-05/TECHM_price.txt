**Summary:**

TECHM (₹1195.37) has underperformed in the recent past, with negative returns across all time frames (12M: -3.03%, 6M: -3.03%, 3M: -3.03%). The stock's volatility is moderate (0.236), and its Sharpe Ratio is negative (-1.531), indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The Max Drawdown of -0.082 suggests a moderate level of price decline. Correlation analysis reveals that TECHM has a moderate to strong relationship with its peers, particularly TCS (0.6123).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for TECHM. The negative returns and poor risk-adjusted performance are concerns, but the moderate volatility and correlation with peers suggest that the stock may not be heavily oversold. Additionally, the Max Drawdown is not extremely high, implying that the stock has not fallen drastically. A HOLD rating allows investors to monitor the stock's performance and wait for a potential turnaround or improvement in fundamentals before making a BUY or SELL decision.
