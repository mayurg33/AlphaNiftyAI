**Summary:**

TATAMOTORS has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -10.20%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.363, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.546, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The max drawdown is -0.118, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, TATAMOTORS has a moderate positive correlation with MARUTI, but negative correlations with TATASTEEL and TATACONSUM.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for TATAMOTORS. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the max drawdown suggests that the stock is prone to significant declines in value, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlation with MARUTI is positive, it is not strong enough to outweigh the other negative factors. Overall, it may be wise to avoid TATAMOTORS for now and consider alternative investment opportunities.
