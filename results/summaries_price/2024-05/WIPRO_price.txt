**Summary:**

Wipro's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -4.20%, indicating a decline in value. The 6-month and 3-month returns are also negative, suggesting a consistent downward trend. The volatility of the stock is moderate, at 0.185. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. The maximum drawdown is relatively low, at -0.062. Correlation analysis shows that Wipro has a moderate positive correlation with its peers INFY and TCS, but a low correlation with POWERGRID. 

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position for Wipro. The consistent negative returns over various time periods, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio, suggest that the stock is not attractive from a risk-return perspective. The moderate volatility and low maximum drawdown do not provide sufficient comfort to hold onto the stock. Additionally, the peer correlations do not indicate any significant diversification benefits. Therefore, it may be prudent to exit the position and explore other investment opportunities with more promising returns and risk profiles.
