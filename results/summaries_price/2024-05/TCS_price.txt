**Summary:**

TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -4.29%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.192, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not compensating for the risk taken. The Max Drawdown is relatively low at -7.1%, suggesting that the stock has not experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis reveals that TCS has a positive correlation with TATACONSUM (0.4246) and TATASTEEL (0.1482), but a negative correlation with TATAMOTORS (-0.3009).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** recommendation for TCS. The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. However, the moderate volatility and relatively low Max Drawdown suggest that the stock may not be overly risky. Additionally, the correlation analysis reveals that TCS is not highly correlated with its peers, which could be a positive factor. Therefore, a HOLD recommendation is warranted, as investors may want to wait for a more favorable entry point or for the stock to demonstrate improved performance before making a buying or selling decision.
