**Summary:**

Hindustan Unilever (HINDUNILVR) has experienced a decline in its stock price over the past year, with a 12-month return of -6.14%. The stock has also been volatile, with a volatility measure of 0.178. The Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns, is a concerning -4.408, indicating that the stock's returns have not been sufficient to compensate for its risk. The maximum drawdown, or peak-to-trough decline, has been 6.7%. Correlations with peers RELIANCE, NESTLEIND, and TATACONSUM are moderate to high, suggesting that HINDUNILVR's performance is closely tied to the broader consumer goods sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's negative returns over various time horizons, combined with its high volatility and poor risk-adjusted performance, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlations with peers indicate that the stock is unlikely to outperform the broader sector, which may be experiencing challenges. Investors may want to consider reallocating their portfolio to more attractive opportunities.
