ADANIPORTS has shown a modest 1.26% return over the past 12 months, with consistent performance across different time frames (6M and 3M). The stock's volatility is relatively low at 0.341, and its Sharpe Ratio of 0.620 indicates a decent risk-return tradeoff. The maximum drawdown of -0.083 suggests that the stock has not experienced significant losses. In terms of peer correlation, ADANIPORTS has a moderate correlation with its peers, with an average correlation of 0.4326.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for ADANIPORTS. The stock's consistent performance and relatively low volatility are positives. However, the returns are not exceptionally high, and the peer correlation is moderate, indicating that the stock is not significantly outperforming or underperforming its peers. Additionally, the Sharpe Ratio, while decent, is not exceptionally high. Therefore, I would recommend holding the stock for now, but monitoring its performance closely for any changes in the market or industry trends that could impact its prospects.
