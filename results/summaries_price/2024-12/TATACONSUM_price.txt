Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a SELL rating for TATACONSUM. The stock's poor 12-month return, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the moderate correlation with TATAMOTORS and low correlation with other peers may indicate that the stock is not well-diversified, which could increase its risk. Overall, it may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better return profiles and more attractive risk-adjusted returns.
