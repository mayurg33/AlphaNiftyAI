The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.174, and its Sharpe Ratio is -6.788, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for HINDALCO. The stock's poor performance over the past year, accompanied by a high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, indicates that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown suggests that the stock is prone to significant declines, which could result in further losses for investors.
