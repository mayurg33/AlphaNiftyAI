**Summary:**

Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID) has had a disappointing performance in 2024, with a 12-month return of -5.84%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.160, and its Sharpe Ratio is a poor -4.646, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -0.082, which is a significant decline. In terms of peer correlation, POWERGRID has a moderate correlation with COALINDIA (0.552), but relatively low correlations with ITC (0.171) and NTPC (0.1938).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance and high risk profile, I would recommend a **SELL** on POWERGRID. The negative returns and low Sharpe Ratio suggest that investors are not being adequately compensated for the risk they are taking. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant declines, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlations are not extremely high, they are still significant, which could imply that POWERGRID is not providing a unique investment opportunity. Overall, it may be wise to reconsider holding POWERGRID in one's portfolio.
