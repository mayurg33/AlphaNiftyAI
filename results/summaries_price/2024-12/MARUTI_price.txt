--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

Maruti's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -3.39%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.141, and the Sharpe Ratio is a negative 3.002, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.051 indicates that the stock has fallen by around 5.1% from its peak. Correlation analysis with peers shows that Maruti's stock movement is closely linked with BAJAJ-AUTO and TATAMOTORS, with correlations of 0.7031 and 0.6306, respectively.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's negative returns, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted performance (as indicated by the Sharpe Ratio) suggest that investors may not be adequately compensated for the risk taken. Additionally, the high correlation with peers may indicate a lack of diversification benefits. With a Max Drawdown of -0.051, the stock has already fallen significantly, and there may be further downside risk.
