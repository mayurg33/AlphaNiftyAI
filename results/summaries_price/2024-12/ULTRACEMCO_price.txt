**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO's stock performance has been lackluster in 2024, with a 12-month return of -1.91%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.179. The Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is -1.270, suggesting that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The maximum drawdown of -0.066 indicates that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in value. Correlation analysis with peers GRASIM, HEROMOTOCO, and LT shows a moderate to high correlation, indicating that ULTRACEMCO's performance is influenced by its peers.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for ULTRACEMCO. The stock's negative returns, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted performance (as indicated by the Sharpe Ratio) make it an unattractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the moderate to high correlation with peers suggests that the stock's performance is influenced by broader market trends, making it more challenging to generate alpha. Given these factors, it may be wise to consider reallocating investments to more promising opportunities.
