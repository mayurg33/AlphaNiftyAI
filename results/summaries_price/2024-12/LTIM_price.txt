LTIM's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -10.10%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.346, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.696, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The max drawdown of -0.171 indicates a significant decline in the stock's value at some point in the past year.

Recommendation:

Based on the poor performance, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a SELL on LTIM. The stock's decline in value and lack of significant correlation with its peers suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. It may be wise to consider alternative investments that offer better returns with lower risk.
