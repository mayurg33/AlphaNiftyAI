**Summary:**

Grasim Industries Limited (GRASIM) has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -9.31%. The stock has been highly volatile, with a volatility measure of 0.180, and its Sharpe Ratio is -6.745, indicating that the returns have not justified the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.101 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, GRASIM has a high correlation with Reliance (0.7693) and UltraTech Cement (0.7035), but a relatively lower correlation with Britannia (0.3983).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor performance of GRASIM over the past year, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's underperformance and high risk profile do not justify holding onto it, and investors may be better off allocating their resources to other opportunities with more attractive risk-return profiles. Furthermore, the high correlation with Reliance and UltraTech Cement suggests that GRASIM may be subject to similar market and industry trends, which could continue to weigh on its performance.
