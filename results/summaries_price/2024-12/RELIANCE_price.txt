**Summary:**

RELIANCE has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -7.16%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.164. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The maximum drawdown is 8.9%, which is a significant decline. The stock's correlation with its peers is moderate to high, with an average correlation of 0.611.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for RELIANCE. The stock's poor performance over the past year, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers suggests that the stock is likely to move in tandem with the broader market, which may not be favorable given the current market conditions.
