NTPC's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -6.94%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.192, and the Sharpe Ratio is -4.628, suggesting that the return is not justified by the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.111 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year.

**Recommendation:**

Considering the poor performance of NTPC's stock, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **SELL**.

Investors may want to consider reallocating their portfolio to more promising opportunities.
