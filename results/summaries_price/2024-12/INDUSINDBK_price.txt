**Summary:**

IndusInd Bank's (INDUSINDBK) stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -3.11%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.221, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.690, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is -0.070, which is relatively low. Correlation analysis with peers reveals that INDUSINDBK has a moderate correlation with ICICIBANK (0.2298) and SBIN (0.3422), but a high correlation with AXISBANK (0.5732). The average peer correlation is 0.3817.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** recommendation for INDUSINDBK. While the stock's performance has been poor, the moderate volatility and low maximum drawdown suggest that the stock may not be overly risky. Additionally, the peer correlations indicate that INDUSINDBK is not significantly different from its peers. However, the poor Sharpe Ratio and negative returns over various time periods suggest that there may be better investment opportunities available. Therefore, I would recommend holding the stock for now, but closely monitoring its performance and considering alternative investments.
