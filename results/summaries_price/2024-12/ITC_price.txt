Here is a short summary and recommendation based on the provided data:

**Summary:**

ITC's stock performance has been modest, with a 12-month return of 1.35%, which is consistent across different time frames (6M and 3M). The stock's volatility is relatively low at 0.154, and its Sharpe Ratio is a decent 1.170, indicating a reasonable balance between risk and return. The maximum drawdown is a manageable -0.035. In terms of peer correlations, ITC has a moderate correlation with ICICIBANK (0.2351) and relatively high correlations with RELIANCE (0.5922) and HINDUNILVR (0.5526), with an average peer correlation of 0.46.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** on ITC. The stock's returns are modest, but the low volatility and decent Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may be a stable investment. The peer correlations indicate that ITC is not overly influenced by its peers, which could be beneficial in times of market volatility. However, the returns are not exceptional, and there may be better opportunities available in the market. Therefore, I would suggest holding ITC for now, but monitoring its performance and re-evaluating the investment thesis periodically.
