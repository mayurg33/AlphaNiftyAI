**Summary:**

Eicher Motors (EICHERMOT) has shown stagnant performance over the past 12 months, with a minimal return of 0.04%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.267. The Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return, is 0.150, indicating that the stock's return is not significantly higher than the risk-free rate. The maximum drawdown of -0.053 suggests that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in the past. In terms of peer correlation, Eicher Motors has a strong positive correlation with Bajaj Auto (0.6234), a moderate positive correlation with M&M (0.3386), and a weak negative correlation with Hero MotoCorp (-0.0353).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for Eicher Motors. The stock's stagnant performance and low Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the moderate volatility and maximum drawdown suggest that the stock may not be suitable for risk-averse investors. However, the strong positive correlation with Bajaj Auto and moderate positive correlation with M&M may indicate that the stock is closely tied to the automotive sector, which could lead to potential gains if the sector experiences an upswing. Overall, investors may want to monitor the stock's performance and re-evaluate their investment decision if the stock shows signs of improvement.
