**Summary:**

BAJAJ-AUTO's stock performance has been steady, with a 12-month return of 2.61%. The volatility is relatively low at 0.222, and the Sharpe Ratio of 1.727 indicates a strong risk-adjusted return. The Max Drawdown of -0.055 suggests that the stock has been relatively resilient to market downturns. Correlation analysis reveals that BAJAJ-AUTO moves closely with its peers, particularly MARUTI, with an average peer correlation of 0.5349.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I recommend a **HOLD** on BAJAJ-AUTO. The stock's steady performance, low volatility, and strong Sharpe Ratio suggest that it is a stable investment. However, the relatively low returns in the past 12 months, 6 months, and 3 months indicate that the stock may not have significant upside potential in the short term. Additionally, the high correlation with peers, especially MARUTI, suggests that the stock's performance may be influenced by industry trends rather than company-specific factors. Therefore, a hold strategy is recommended, allowing investors to monitor the stock's performance and adjust their position as needed.
