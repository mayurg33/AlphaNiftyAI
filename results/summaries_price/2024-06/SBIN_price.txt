**Summary:**

State Bank of India (SBIN) has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -6.26%. The stock has been volatile, with a volatility measure of 0.584, and has a negative Sharpe Ratio of -1.246, indicating that the returns have not justified the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown has been 14.4%, which is a significant decline. The stock has a high correlation with its peers, particularly ICICIBANK, AXISBANK, and HDFCBANK, suggesting that it is closely tied to the broader banking sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for SBIN. The negative returns and high volatility indicate that the stock is not attractive at current levels. Additionally, the high correlation with peers suggests that the stock is likely to continue to be influenced by broader sector trends, rather than individual company performance. However, the stock's current price of ₹832.24 may present a buying opportunity if the banking sector as a whole experiences a rebound. It is essential to monitor the stock's performance and sector trends before making a buying or selling decision.
