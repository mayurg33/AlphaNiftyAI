**Summary:**

ADANIPORTS has experienced a decline in its stock price, with a 12-month return of -6.28%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a Sharpe Ratio of -0.537, indicating that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.211 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in the past. In terms of peer correlation, ADANIPORTS has a strong correlation with ADANIENT (0.9679) and SBIN (0.9088), but a relatively weaker correlation with MARUTI (0.5677). The average peer correlation is 0.8148, indicating that the stock tends to move in line with its peers.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for ADANIPORTS. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggest that the risk-reward profile is not favorable. Additionally, the strong correlation with its peers implies that the stock is likely to follow the broader market trend, rather than outperforming it. However, given the stock's moderate volatility, it may be worth holding onto for now, rather than selling, in hopes of a potential rebound. A more detailed analysis of the company's fundamentals and market conditions would be necessary to determine a more decisive course of action.
