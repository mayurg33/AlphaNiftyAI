**Summary:**

The stock ADANIENT has underperformed in the past year, with a 12-month return of -12.81%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.787, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.011, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The stock has a high correlation with its peers, particularly ADANIPORTS, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9679.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the past year, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers indicates that the stock is likely to follow the trend of the industry, which may not be positive in the current market conditions. It may be wise to consider diversifying the portfolio by selling ADANIENT and investing in other stocks with better performance and risk-return profiles.
