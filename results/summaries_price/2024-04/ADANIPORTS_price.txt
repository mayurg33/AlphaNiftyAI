**Summary:**

ADANIPORTS has been underperforming in the past 12 months, with a return of -3.71%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.178, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.727, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is -0.077, suggesting a relatively stable stock. In terms of peer correlation, ADANIPORTS has a moderate positive correlation with ADANIENT and SBIN, and a negative correlation with MARUTI. The average peer correlation is 0.2645, indicating some diversification benefits.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on ADANIPORTS. While the stock's underperformance and poor risk-adjusted return are concerning, its moderate volatility and relatively stable price movement suggest that it may not be a high-risk investment. Furthermore, the peer correlations indicate some diversification benefits, which could be attractive for investors seeking to reduce portfolio risk. However, I would not recommend buying more shares at this time, as the stock's performance has been disappointing. Instead, investors may want to monitor the stock's future performance and re-evaluate their position if there are signs of improvement.
