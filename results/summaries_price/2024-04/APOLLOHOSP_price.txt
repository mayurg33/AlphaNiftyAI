The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.305, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.420, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The maximum drawdown is -0.086, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value.

The average peer correlation is 0.0791, indicating a relatively low correlation with its peers.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** rating for Apollo Hospitals (APOLLOHOSP). The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggests that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the mixed peer correlation and low average peer correlation may indicate that the stock is not closely tied to its peers, which could make it more difficult to predict its future performance. Overall, investors may want to consider alternative investment options with more promising returns and lower volatility.
