--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

Larsen & Toubro (LT) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -6.35%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.200, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.255, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is -8.3%, which is a significant decline. The peer correlations suggest that LT has a moderate correlation with RELIANCE (0.3998), a strong correlation with ULTRACEMCO (0.7088), and a negative correlation with ONGC (-0.1638).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for LT. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns, indicate a lack of investor confidence. Additionally, the significant maximum drawdown suggests that the stock is prone to sudden declines. While the peer correlations suggest some diversification benefits, they do not outweigh the overall negative sentiment around the stock. It may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better growth prospects and more attractive risk-return profiles.
