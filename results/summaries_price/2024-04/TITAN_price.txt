**Summary:**

Titan Company Ltd (TITAN) has been underperforming in the last 12 months, with a return of -3.99%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.216, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.393, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is relatively low at -0.068. In terms of peer correlation, TITAN has a moderate correlation with TATACONSUM (0.2921) and TATAMOTORS (0.3504), but a low correlation with TATASTEEL (0.0178).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on TITAN. While the stock's performance has been disappointing, its volatility and maximum drawdown are not alarmingly high. Additionally, the peer correlations suggest that TITAN is not overly influenced by its peers, which could indicate some degree of independence in its price movement. However, the poor risk-adjusted performance and negative returns over various timeframes warrant caution. It may be prudent to monitor the stock's performance and re-evaluate the position if there are signs of improvement or deterioration.
