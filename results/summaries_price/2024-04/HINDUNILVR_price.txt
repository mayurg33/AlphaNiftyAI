Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HINDUNILVR) has underperformed in the recent past, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M). The stock has declined from ₹2223.40 to ₹2169.47, resulting in a 2.43% loss. The volatility of the stock is moderate at 0.120. The Sharpe Ratio is -2.649, indicating that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The Max Drawdown is 4.1%, which is relatively low. Correlation analysis shows that HINDUNILVR has a moderate correlation with RELIANCE and TATACONSUM, but a very low correlation with NESTLEIND.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** position on Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HINDUNILVR) for the time being. Although the stock has underperformed recently, its moderate volatility and relatively low Max Drawdown suggest that it may be due for a rebound. Additionally, its correlation with peers is not extremely high, which could indicate that it may not be heavily influenced by market trends. However, before making a BUY decision, I would like to see some signs of improvement in the stock's performance, such as a reversal in its price trend or a improvement in its fundamental metrics.
