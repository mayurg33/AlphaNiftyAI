**Summary:**

ITC's stock performance in April 2024 was modest, with a return of 2.10% over the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month periods. The stock demonstrated low volatility, with a volatility measure of 0.176. The Sharpe Ratio of 1.651 indicates that the stock's return was relatively high compared to its risk. The Max Drawdown of -0.041 suggests that the stock has been relatively stable. Correlation analysis with peers ICICIBANK, RELIANCE, and HINDUNILVR indicates a moderate positive correlation, with an average peer correlation of 0.2863.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** on ITC. The stock's stable performance, low volatility, and relatively high Sharpe Ratio suggest that it is a relatively attractive investment opportunity. However, the modest returns and lack of significant upside momentum in the recent period do not warrant a strong **BUY** recommendation. Additionally, the average peer correlation is moderate, indicating that ITC's performance is influenced by the broader market trends, but not excessively so. Overall, holding onto ITC stock may be a reasonable strategy, but investors may want to monitor its performance and adjust their position as market conditions evolve.
