**Summary:**

TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -2.45%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.166, and its Sharpe Ratio is -1.899, indicating a poor risk-adjusted return. The maximum drawdown is 4.6%, which is relatively low. In terms of peer correlation, TCS has a low correlation with TATASTEEL, a moderate correlation with TATACONSUM, and a high correlation with TATAMOTORS.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on TCS. Although the stock has underperformed in the past 12 months, its moderate volatility and low maximum drawdown suggest that it may not be a highly risky investment. Additionally, the high correlation with TATAMOTORS could indicate that TCS is closely tied to the Tata group's performance, which may be a positive factor. However, the poor Sharpe Ratio and negative returns over various time periods do not warrant a **BUY** recommendation at this time. Further analysis and monitoring of the stock's performance are necessary before making a more decisive call.
