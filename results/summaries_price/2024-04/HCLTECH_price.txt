**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the significant max drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to large losses, which could be a concern for investors. While the peer correlations are not extremely concerning, they do not provide a compelling reason to hold or buy the stock. Overall, it may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better performance and risk profiles.
