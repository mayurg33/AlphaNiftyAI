**Summary:**

BAJAJ-AUTO's stock performance has been lackluster over the past 12 months, with a return of -1.53%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.238, and its Sharpe Ratio is -0.747, indicating that the returns have not been impressive considering the risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.062 suggests that the stock has experienced a moderate decline in value. The peer correlations with BAJFINANCE, BAJAJFINSV, and MARUTI are all negative, indicating that BAJAJ-AUTO's stock movement is not closely tied to its peers.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on BAJAJ-AUTO. The stock's lackluster performance and negative Sharpe Ratio suggest that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. However, the moderate volatility and Max Drawdown indicate that the stock may not be overly risky. Additionally, the negative peer correlations suggest that BAJAJ-AUTO's stock movement may be influenced by unique factors, which could potentially lead to a turnaround. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold the stock and monitor its performance before making a buy or sell decision.
