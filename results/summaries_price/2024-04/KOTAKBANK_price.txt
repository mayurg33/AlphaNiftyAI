Here is a short summary and recommendation based on the provided data:

**Summary:**
Kotak Bank's stock has been underperforming, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M) of -9.31%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.452, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.633, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The Max Drawdown of -0.127 suggests a significant decline in the stock's value. Peer correlations are mostly negative, with an average correlation of -0.0604, indicating that Kotak Bank's stock movement is not closely tied to its peers.

**Recommendation:**
Based on the negative returns, poor risk-adjusted performance, and moderate volatility, I would recommend a **SELL** or **AVOID** Kotak Bank's stock at this time. The stock's underperformance and lack of correlation with its peers suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity in the current market conditions. It may be wise to explore other investment options with better growth prospects and risk-adjusted returns.
