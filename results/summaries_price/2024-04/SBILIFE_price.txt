**Summary:**

SBILIFE has been underperforming in the past year, with a 12-month return of -3.58%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.184, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.537, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is -0.068, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in the past. Correlation analysis shows that SBILIFE has a moderate correlation with its peers, with an average peer correlation of 0.3936.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** rating for SBILIFE. The stock's poor performance over the past year, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, suggests that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high maximum drawdown indicates that the stock is prone to significant declines, which could result in further losses for investors. While the peer correlations are moderate, they do not provide a strong enough signal to contradict the overall negative sentiment on the stock.
