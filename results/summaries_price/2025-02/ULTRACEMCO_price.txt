**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -10.04%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.296, and its Sharpe Ratio is -4.591, suggesting that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.130 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year. The peer correlations suggest that ULTRACEMCO's stock movement is moderately correlated with its peers, particularly GRASIM and HEROMOTOCO.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for ULTRACEMCO. The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the Max Drawdown suggests that the stock may be prone to significant declines in value, which could result in losses for investors. While the peer correlations are moderately high, they do not necessarily imply that the stock will perform well in the future. Therefore, it may be wise to consider selling or avoiding ULTRACEMCO stock for now.
