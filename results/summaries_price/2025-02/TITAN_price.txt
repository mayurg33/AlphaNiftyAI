**Summary:**

Titan Company Ltd (TITAN) has had a disappointing performance over the past year, with a 12-month return of -13.37%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.234, but its Sharpe Ratio is alarmingly low at -7.999, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of 14.5% is also a concern. While peer correlations are moderate to low, suggesting some diversification benefits, the overall trend is bearish.

**Recommendation:**

**SELL**

The combination of poor returns, high volatility, and low Sharpe Ratio makes Titan Company Ltd a unattractive investment opportunity at this time. The stock's performance is likely to continue to be weak, and investors may want to consider alternative investments with better risk-return profiles.
