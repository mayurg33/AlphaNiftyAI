**Summary:**

Infosys (INFY) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -8.84%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.232, and its Sharpe Ratio is -5.178, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown is 11.9%, which is a significant decline. In terms of peer correlation, INFY has a strong positive correlation with TCS (0.8323) and WIPRO (0.7104), but a negligible correlation with ITC (-0.0065). The average peer correlation is 0.5121, suggesting that INFY moves in line with its peers in the IT sector.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** rating for Infosys (INFY). While the stock's underperformance and poor risk-adjusted returns are concerns, its strong correlation with peers in the IT sector suggests that it may be more of a sector-wide issue rather than a company-specific problem. Additionally, the moderate volatility indicates that the stock may not be extremely overvalued or undervalued at this point. However, I would recommend monitoring the stock's performance and the broader IT sector before making a BUY or SELL decision.
