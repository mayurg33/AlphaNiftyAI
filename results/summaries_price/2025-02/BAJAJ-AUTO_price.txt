**Summary:**

Bajaj Auto's stock performance has been disappointing over the past 12 months, with a return of -13.68%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.221. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown is -13.7%, which suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. The peer correlations indicate that Bajaj Auto's stock movement is not highly correlated with its peers, except for Bajaj Finance, with which it has a moderate positive correlation.

**Recommendation:**

**SELL**

The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with a negative Sharpe Ratio and high maximum drawdown, suggest that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at this time. The lack of strong correlations with its peers also implies that the stock's performance is not driven by industry or market trends, making it more difficult to predict its future movement. Therefore, it is recommended to sell the stock and consider alternative investment opportunities.
