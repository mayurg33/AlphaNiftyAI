**Summary:**

Maruti (MARUTI) has had a disappointing performance over the past 12 months, with a return of -7.51%, underperforming the market. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.181, but its Sharpe Ratio is a concerning -5.641, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance. The maximum drawdown of -0.091 suggests the stock has experienced significant declines in value. Correlation analysis with peers M&M, TATAMOTORS, and BAJAJ-AUTO reveals a moderate to low correlation, suggesting Maruti's performance is not closely tied to its peers.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position for Maruti (MARUTI). The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, coupled with its high volatility and poor risk-adjusted returns, suggests that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the maximum drawdown indicates that the stock has experienced significant declines in value, which could be a concern for investors. While the correlation analysis suggests that Maruti's performance is not closely tied to its peers, the overall negative sentiment and poor performance metrics outweigh any potential benefits.
