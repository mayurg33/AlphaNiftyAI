**Summary:**

State Bank of India (SBIN) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -10.08%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.171, and its Sharpe Ratio is -8.114, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is -0.116, suggesting that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, SBIN has a moderate correlation with ICICIBANK (0.4502) and AXISBANK (0.4295), but a relatively low correlation with HDFCBANK (0.1633).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's underperformance over the last 12 months, combined with its poor risk-adjusted returns and high maximum drawdown, suggest that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the moderate correlation with its peers suggests that the stock may be influenced by industry trends, which could further exacerbate its decline.
