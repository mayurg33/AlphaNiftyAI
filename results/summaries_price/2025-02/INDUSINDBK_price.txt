**Summary:**

IndusInd Bank's stock (INDUSINDBK) has been underperforming in the recent past, with negative returns across all time frames (12M, 6M, and 3M) of -1.91%. The stock's volatility is relatively high at 0.316, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The Max Drawdown of -0.082 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, IndusInd Bank's stock is moderately correlated with its peers, ICICIBANK, AXISBANK, and SBIN.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for IndusInd Bank's stock. The negative returns across all time frames, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted returns indicate a bearish trend. Additionally, the Max Drawdown suggests that the stock has already experienced a significant decline, which may not be fully priced in. While the peer correlation is moderate, it does not suggest a strong upside potential. Overall, it may be prudent to exit the stock and explore other investment opportunities with better return profiles.
