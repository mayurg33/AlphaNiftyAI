--- LLM Output ---
**Summary:**

LTIM has been experiencing a significant decline in its stock price, with a 12-month return of -21.00%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.337. The Sharpe Ratio is extremely low at -9.060, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown is -0.226, suggesting that the stock has fallen by approximately 22.6% from its peak. Peer correlations suggest that LTIM is moderately correlated with TECHM (0.7023) and less correlated with TITAN (0.1893) and ITC (-0.1217).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high volatility, and extremely low Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the Max Drawdown suggests that the stock has fallen significantly from its peak, which could indicate a potential reversal or further decline. While the peer correlations suggest some diversification benefits, they are not strong enough to justify holding onto the stock given its poor performance. It may be wise to consider alternative investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
