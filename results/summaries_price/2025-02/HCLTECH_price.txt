**Summary:**

HCLTECH's stock has been underperforming, with a 12-month return of -7.02%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.215. The Sharpe Ratio is -4.374, suggesting that the stock's return is not justified by its risk. The maximum drawdown is -0.092, indicating a significant decline in value. In terms of peer correlation, HCLTECH has a high correlation with TECHM (0.7291) and a moderate correlation with HDFCLIFE (0.4081).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's negative returns, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlation with TECHM suggests that HCLTECH may be closely tied to the performance of the technology sector, which may be experiencing a downturn. Given the lack of positive momentum and the stock's poor performance, it may be wise to divest from HCLTECH and explore other investment opportunities.
