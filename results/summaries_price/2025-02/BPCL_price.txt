**Summary:**

BPCL's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -7.18%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.258. The Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is negative, suggesting that the return is not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -10.2% indicates that the stock has experienced significant price drops in the past. Correlation analysis with peers ONGC, SBIN, and RELIANCE shows that BPCL's performance is closely tied to ONGC and moderately correlated with SBIN and RELIANCE.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The negative returns over various time horizons, high volatility, and poor risk-adjusted performance (as indicated by the Sharpe Ratio) suggest that the stock is not a good investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the high correlation with ONGC and moderate correlation with other peers may indicate that BPCL is heavily influenced by industry-specific factors, making it vulnerable to sectoral downturns. Therefore, it is prudent to exit or avoid this stock until its fundamentals improve.
