The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.142, and the Sharpe Ratio is a concerning -13.196, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** rating for ITC. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, suggests that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the moderate correlation with its peers implies that ITC may not offer significant diversification benefits. Investors may want to consider alternative investment opportunities with better return profiles and lower volatility.
