**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** on Bharti Airtel Limited (BHARTIARTL). The stock's underperformance in the past 12 months, coupled with a negative Sharpe Ratio, suggests that the stock's risk is not justified by its return. Additionally, the moderate volatility and low maximum drawdown do not indicate a strong buying opportunity. However, the average peer correlation is relatively low, which could indicate that the stock is not closely tied to the overall market or its peers. Therefore, a hold recommendation is warranted, as the stock may require further evaluation and monitoring before making a buy or sell decision.
