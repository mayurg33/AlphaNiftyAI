**Summary:**

Reliance Industries Ltd. (RELIANCE) has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -5.10%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.172, and its Sharpe Ratio is -3.949, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown is -0.066, suggesting a moderate level of risk. The stock's correlation with its peers is mixed, with a high correlation with LT (0.6821) and low correlations with GRASIM (0.0893) and HINDUNILVR (0.1693).

**Suggested Action:**

Considering the stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, high volatility, and poor Sharpe Ratio, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation. The stock's current price of ₹1200.10 is lower than its starting price of ₹1264.60, indicating a downward trend. Additionally, the average peer correlation is relatively low, suggesting that the stock's performance is not closely tied to its peers, making it a less attractive investment opportunity.
