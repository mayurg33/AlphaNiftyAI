**Summary:**

Kotak Bank's stock has been underperforming, with negative returns across all timeframes (12M, 6M, and 3M). The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.123, and its Sharpe Ratio is -0.623, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The Max Drawdown is relatively low at -0.031, suggesting that the stock has not experienced significant price drops. The peer correlations indicate that Kotak Bank's stock movement is moderately correlated with its peers, particularly with ICICIBANK.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the poor returns and negative Sharpe Ratio, I would recommend a **SELL** on Kotak Bank's stock. The stock's underperformance across multiple timeframes and lack of strong upside potential make it an unattractive investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the moderate correlation with its peers suggests that the stock may not be able to differentiate itself from its competitors, further supporting a sell decision.
