**Summary:**

Coal India Ltd (COALINDIA) has been underperforming in the past 12 months, with a return of -1.89%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.360, and its Sharpe Ratio is negative, indicating that the returns are not justified by the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.075 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis with peers shows a strong positive correlation with TATASTEEL and POWERGRID, indicating that the stock is closely tied to the performance of these companies.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** on Coal India Ltd (COALINDIA). The stock's underperformance over the past 12 months, combined with its negative Sharpe Ratio and moderate volatility, suggests that the risk-reward profile is not favorable. Additionally, the strong correlation with peers in the same industry may indicate that the stock is subject to industry-specific risks, which could further negatively impact its performance.
