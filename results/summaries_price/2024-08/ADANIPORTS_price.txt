**Summary:**

ADANIPORTS has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -6.81%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.288, and its Sharpe Ratio is -2.942, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The maximum drawdown of -0.081 suggests a significant decline in the stock's value. Correlation analysis reveals that ADANIPORTS has a high correlation with ADANIENT (0.8815) and moderate correlations with MARUTI (0.5995) and SBIN (0.7495).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **SELL** recommendation for ADANIPORTS. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and negative Sharpe Ratio, indicate a lack of value in holding the stock. Additionally, the high correlation with ADANIENT suggests that the stock's performance is heavily influenced by its peer, which may not be a positive factor in the current market conditions. Overall, it may be prudent to exit the stock and explore other investment opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
