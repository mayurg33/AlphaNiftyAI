**Summary:**

Grasim Industries Ltd. (GRASIM) has underperformed in the last 12 months, with a return of -2.09%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.294, and its Sharpe Ratio is -0.764, indicating that the return is not justified by the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -0.089 suggests that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value. Correlation analysis reveals that GRASIM has a strong positive correlation with ULTRACEMCO (0.7149) and a moderate positive correlation with RELIANCE (0.5656), but a weak correlation with BRITANNIA (0.2272).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would suggest a **HOLD** position for GRASIM. The stock's underperformance in the last 12 months, combined with its moderate volatility and poor Sharpe Ratio, indicates that it may not be an attractive investment opportunity at present. Additionally, the strong correlation with ULTRACEMCO and moderate correlation with RELIANCE may suggest that GRASIM is closely tied to the performance of these peers, which could impact its future returns. However, before making a **SELL** decision, it's essential to consider other factors such as the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and future growth prospects. It's recommended to monitor the stock's performance and re-evaluate the position in the coming months.
