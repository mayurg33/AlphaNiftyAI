**Summary:**

ULTRACEMCO's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 12-month return of -5.70%, indicating a decline in value. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.224, and the Sharpe Ratio is -3.191, suggesting that the returns are not compensating for the level of risk taken. The Max Drawdown of -0.082 indicates that the stock has experienced a significant decline in value at some point in the past year. The peer correlations suggest that ULTRACEMCO's stock movement is closely tied to its peers in the industry.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL**. The stock's poor performance over the past 12 months, combined with its high volatility and low Sharpe Ratio, indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high peer correlations suggest that the stock's performance is closely tied to the industry, which may not be favorable in the current market conditions. It may be wise to consider diversifying the portfolio by selling ULTRACEMCO and investing in other opportunities with better risk-return profiles.
