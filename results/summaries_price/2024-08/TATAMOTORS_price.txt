**Summary:**

TATAMOTORS has underperformed in the past 12 months, with a return of -2.89%. The stock's volatility is moderate at 0.410, and its Sharpe Ratio is -0.703, indicating that the returns have not justified the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of 11.4% suggests that the stock has experienced significant price drops in the past. In terms of peer correlation, TATAMOTORS has a strong positive correlation with TATASTEEL and MARUTI, but a weak correlation with TATACONSUM.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **HOLD** position on TATAMOTORS. The stock's underperformance and high volatility suggest that it may not be an attractive buy at this point. However, the strong correlation with TATASTEEL and MARUTI indicates that the stock may be influenced by industry trends, and a turnaround in the sector could benefit TATAMOTORS. Additionally, the average peer correlation of 0.4306 suggests that the stock's performance is somewhat tied to its peers. Therefore, a hold position allows for monitoring of the stock's performance and potential adjustment of the position based on future market developments.
