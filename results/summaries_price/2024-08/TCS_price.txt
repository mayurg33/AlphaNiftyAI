TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) has demonstrated a consistent performance over the past 12 months, with a return of 3.56%. The stock's volatility is moderate, with a standard deviation of 0.228. The Sharpe Ratio of 2.045 indicates that the returns have been generated with relatively low risk. The maximum drawdown of -0.055 suggests that the stock has been resilient during market downturns. In terms of peer correlation, TCS has a low correlation with TATACONSUM (0.1912), but a relatively high correlation with TATAMOTORS (0.6528) and TATASTEEL (0.637).

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **BUY**. The consistent returns, moderate volatility, and strong Sharpe Ratio suggest that TCS is a relatively stable and attractive investment opportunity. The low correlation with TATACONSUM and average correlation with other peers indicate that the stock can provide diversification benefits to a portfolio. Additionally, the maximum drawdown suggests that the stock has the potential to weather market fluctuations. Overall, I believe that TCS is a good addition to a portfolio, especially for investors seeking a relatively stable and consistent performer in the technology sector.
