**Summary:**

Maruti Suzuki (MARUTI) has experienced a decline in its stock price, with a 12-month return of -6.28%. The stock has been volatile, with a volatility measure of 0.241, and has a poor Sharpe Ratio of -3.270, indicating that the returns are not justified by the level of risk taken. The maximum drawdown has been -8.3%, which is a significant decline. The stock has a moderate to high correlation with its peers, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Tata Motors (TATAMOTORS), and Bajaj Auto (BAJAJ-AUTO), with an average peer correlation of 0.5534.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a **SELL** position on Maruti Suzuki (MARUTI). The stock's poor performance, high volatility, and negative Sharpe Ratio indicate that it may not be a good investment opportunity at this time. Additionally, the high correlation with its peers suggests that the stock is likely to follow the broader industry trend, which may not be favorable in the current market conditions. It may be wise to reassess the stock's prospects in the future, but for now, a sell position seems prudent.
