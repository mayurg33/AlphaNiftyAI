Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Although BPCL's Q3 results were disappointing, brokerages are bullish on its long-term growth outlook, and the company has announced a â‚¹5 dividend, which is a positive sign. Given the mixed sentiment, it's best to hold the stock for now and wait for the next quarter's results to make a more informed decision.
