After analyzing the recent headlines about TATACONSUM, I observe a mixed sentiment with a slight positive bias. While some articles highlight the company's revenue growth and strong domestic business performance, others mention the decline in net profit and margin compression due to higher costs.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: Although the Q3 results showed revenue growth, the decline in net profit and margin compression are concerns, and the market reaction is already reflecting this mixed performance; therefore, a HOLD decision is recommended until further clarity on the company's future prospects.
