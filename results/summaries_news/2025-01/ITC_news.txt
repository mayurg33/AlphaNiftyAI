Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The overall news sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, with the demerger of ITC Hotels being seen as a game-changer for shareholders, but the stock price has adjusted downwards due to the ex-demerger effect, and the listing of ITC Hotels has been met with a mixed response, trading at a lower circuit on its listing day.
