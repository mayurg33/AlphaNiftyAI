Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Infosys' Q3 results show an 11.4% rise in profit and 8% increase in revenue, the stock's recent performance is mixed, with some analysts citing concerns over factors such as H1-B visa dependence and others bullish on its North America business growth. Overall, the news sentiment is neutral, suggesting a HOLD position until more clarity emerges on the company's future prospects.
