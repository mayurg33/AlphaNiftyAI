After analyzing the recent headlines about HEROMOTOCO, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the company has reported a sales drop in December and a recent price correction, it is expected to post a decent Q3 result, and its electric vehicle business is expected to grow independently, with the company eyeing double-digit revenue growth this year.
