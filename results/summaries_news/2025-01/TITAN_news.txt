Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with Titan Company announcing a 24% growth in Q3, driven by strong festive sales, particularly in the jewellery segment, which saw a 25-26% increase. This has led to a rally in the stock price, with shares gaining over 6% in two days, indicating a strong investor confidence.
