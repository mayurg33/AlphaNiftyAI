Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While some brokerages and analysts have maintained a "buy" call on ONGC, the recent Q3 results were disappointing, with a 19% YoY fall in PAT, and revenue and profit likely to fall due to lower oil realisations and a weak rupee. However, the stock has already factored in the negative news, and the announcement of an interim dividend might provide some support to the stock.
