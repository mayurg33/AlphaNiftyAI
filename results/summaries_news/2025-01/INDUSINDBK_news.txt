Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Despite the mixed Q3 results, with a decline in standalone PAT, the stock has been gaining for three consecutive sessions, and the net advances have climbed 13% YoY in Q3 FY25, indicating some positive momentum. However, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the stock's decline in recent times, and investors should wait for further clarity before making a buy or sell decision.
