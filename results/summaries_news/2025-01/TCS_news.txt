Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While TCS's Q3 results showed a 12% YoY increase in profit, the company missed profit estimates and had its worst Q3 performance in nine years, indicating that the IT spending has yet to pick up. This mixed performance warrants a cautious approach, and investors should hold onto their existing shares rather than buying or selling.
