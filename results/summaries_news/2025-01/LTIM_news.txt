Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The news sentiment is mixed, with some articles highlighting the company's strong growth momentum and confidence in outperforming FY25, while others report a slip in share price and profit following Q3 results. As the sentiment is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, a hold decision is justified, pending further analysis and assessment of the company's long-term performance.
