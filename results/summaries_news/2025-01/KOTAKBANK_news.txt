Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with the stock rallying over 9% after Q3 results, driven by a 10% YoY rise in net profit and a 14.75% increase in Net Interest Income (NII). Brokerages have also upgraded the stock, citing strong performance and anticipation of the reversal of the RBI ban, making it a top buy call for the medium term.
