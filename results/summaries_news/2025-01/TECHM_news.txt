Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Tech Mahindra's Q3FY25 results showed a 93% jump in net profit, missing street estimates and a 1.4% revenue growth, the stock has already seen a significant single-day jump, indicating market optimism. However, the revenue growth was sluggish, and the company's performance is still on the recovery track, warranting a hold decision until further clarity on the sustainability of the profit growth.
