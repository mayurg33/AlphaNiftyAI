Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The mixed news sentiment, with both positive and negative headlines, suggests that the stock is currently volatile and may not be ideal for buying or selling. The recent quarterly results were strong, with a record profit, but the net profit dropped 10% YoY, and the fundraising plans are still uncertain.
