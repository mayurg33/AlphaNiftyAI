Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The overall news sentiment about Wipro is neutral with a slight negative bias, driven by concerns about the impact of tariff hikes, immigration curbs, and trade war on the company's growth. However, the stock has shown recent trading volume increase and some analysts believe that the current weakness in the stock price may not be justified by its decent financials.
