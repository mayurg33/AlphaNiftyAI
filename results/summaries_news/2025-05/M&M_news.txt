After reviewing the recent headlines about M&M, I have concluded that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL.

Reason: While the company's Q4 results beat street estimates, the board's approval of a rights issue worth â‚¹2,996 crore has dampened investor sentiment, causing a decline in the stock price. However, the rights issue is intended to raise capital for growth, which could be a positive factor in the long run.
