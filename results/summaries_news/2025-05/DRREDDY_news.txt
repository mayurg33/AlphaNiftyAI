Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The overall sentiment is positive, driven by Dr. Reddy's strong Q4 and full-year FY25 financial results, with a 22% YoY increase in profit, record revenue, and a dividend announcement. The analyst community, including JM Financial, also maintains a Buy call, albeit with a lowered target price, indicating confidence in the company's future performance.
