Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the recent Q4 results were disappointing with a 45% decline in net profit, the company has announced a dividend of Rs 20.55 per share, and analysts see a positive outlook for FY26. However, the current muted demand and rising competition are concerns, making it prudent to hold the stock for now and reassess once the company's growth strategies start to bear fruit.
