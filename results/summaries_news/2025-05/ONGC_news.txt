After analyzing the recent headlines about ONGC, I would suggest:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The mixed news sentiment, with some positive developments (resumption of crude oil production, attractive dividend yields) offset by disappointing Q4 results (decline in profit and revenue), warrants a neutral stance, and investors should hold their positions for now.
