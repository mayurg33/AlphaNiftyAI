Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Although Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has received regulatory approval for demerger of its ice cream business, which could unlock value, the overall sentiment is mixed with declining stock prices in recent trading sessions. The company's confidence in growth and improving demand is offset by investor concerns about lacking growth, suggesting a wait-and-watch approach for now.
