Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The overall sentiment is positive, with a "Buy" rating from JM Financial, a target price increase, and a bonus issue and stock split that are viewed as beneficial for investors. Additionally, the company's transition to a new cloud-based lending system is seen as a positive step towards scalable growth.
