After analyzing the recent headlines about LTIMindtree, I have found that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL.

Some positive news includes the company's net profit rising 7.7% YoY to â‚¹1,251 crore, declaration of an interim dividend, and winning its largest deal in history. On the other hand, there are some negative sentiments surrounding the 2% degrowth in its Europe business and the stock crashing 6.5% after Q2 results.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the company's recent quarterly results and deal wins are positive, the degrowth in its Europe business and stock volatility warrant a cautious approach, making a hold decision the most appropriate at this time.
