Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Infosys' Q2 results were mixed, with profit rising 5% but missing estimates, the company's revenue growth and raised FY25 guidance are positive signs, suggesting a strong outlook. However, the stock may have already priced in these positives, making it a hold for now.
