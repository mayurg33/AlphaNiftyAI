After reviewing the recent headlines about HDFCBANK, I observe that the overall news sentiment is POSITIVE.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The bank's Q2 results have beaten street estimates, with a 5% YoY increase in PAT, and the approval of the IPO for HDB Financial Services is a positive development, indicating a potential unlocking of value for HDFCBANK shareholders.
