After analyzing the recent headlines about Titan Company, I have come to the following conclusion:

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite a decline in share price despite a strong Q2 report, brokerages like Morgan Stanley are optimistic about a price rally, and the company has reported 25% YoY growth in business, adding 75 new stores, indicating strong fundamentals.
