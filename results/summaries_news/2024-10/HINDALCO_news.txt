Final Decision: BUY

Reason: Despite the recent dip in share price due to Constellium's earnings report, brokerage firms and technical analysts are optimistic about Hindalco's prospects, recommending to buy the stock for the short-term with target prices higher than the current market price. This suggests that the current dip may be a good entry point for investors.
