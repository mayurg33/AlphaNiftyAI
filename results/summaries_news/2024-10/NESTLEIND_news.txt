Reason: The sentiment around Nestle India's Q2 results is mixed, with some headlines focusing on the marginal fall in profit and others highlighting the 8.6% rise in net profit. However, the overall tone is cautious, citing challenges in demand and a shrinking middle class, which suggests that the stock may not be a compelling buy at this point.
