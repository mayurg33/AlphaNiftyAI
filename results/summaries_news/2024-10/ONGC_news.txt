Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall sentiment around ONGC is positive, with the stock gaining despite a jump in oil prices, and the company exploring new opportunities such as mini-LNG plants to evacuate natural gas from isolated fields. The potential scrapping of the windfall tax on crude oil by the government also bodes well for the company's prospects.
