Reason: The overall sentiment is positive, driven by Tech Mahindra's strong Q2 results, which beat estimates and saw a 153% YoY profit growth, as well as a significant increase in its workforce, indicating a strong operational performance. Additionally, analysts' recommendations, such as Axis Securities' target price raise, suggest a bullish outlook.
