Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Infosys reported a 30% rise in Q4 profit and declared a dividend, the revenue growth of 0.2% in FY24 was a miss, and the company saw its lowest growth in its 43-year history. The stock lost around 1.4% during the trading session, indicating market disappointment, but a HOLD decision is warranted as the company's profit growth and dividend declaration provide some positives to balance out the negatives.
