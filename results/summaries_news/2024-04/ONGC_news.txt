After analyzing the recent headlines about ONGC, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL.

While there are positive developments such as ONGC's order to Maharashtra Seamless and India's crude oil consumption increase, the windfall tax hike has led to profit booking and a dip in ONGC's stock price. Additionally, the overall sentiment in the oil sector seems to be mixed, with some stocks facing pressure due to the tax hike.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The positive developments in ONGC's business and the crude oil consumption increase in India are offset by the recent profit booking and windfall tax hike, warranting a neutral stance.
