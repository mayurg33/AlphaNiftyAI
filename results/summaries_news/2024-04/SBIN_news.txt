Reason: The recent news sentiment about SBI is largely neutral to positive, with the bank making progress in its digital transformation, receiving funding from the World Bank, and being recognized as one of the top lenders in Asia-Pacific. However, there are some minor issues such as the downtime of its net banking and UPI services, which are temporary and do not impact the bank's overall fundamentals.
