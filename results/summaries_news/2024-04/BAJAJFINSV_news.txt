Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Despite the recent tumble in share prices, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have reported strong quarterly results with a jump in profit and revenue. However, the valuations are still high, and the current dip might be an opportunity for investors to accumulate, but it's recommended to hold and monitor the stock for now.
