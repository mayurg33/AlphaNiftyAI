After analyzing the recent headlines about Hero MotoCorp, I have summarized the overall news sentiment as follows:

The news sentiment is generally positive, with Axis Securities recommending Hero MotoCorp as their "pick of the week" and the company opening a new assembly facility in Nepal. However, there are some mixed signals, such as the loss of market share to other players and EV makers, as well as changes in top management. Additionally, the write-off of bad loans by Hero FinCorp, a related company, may raise some concerns.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are some positive developments, the mixed signals and changes in top management warrant a cautious approach, and investors may want to wait and see how the company's strategy unfolds before making a buying or selling decision.
