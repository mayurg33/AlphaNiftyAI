Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While HUL's Q4 results were in-line with expectations, the net profit dip and lackluster rural sales performance may lead to short-term volatility, but the company's focus on six key categories and domestic volume growth of 2% suggest potential for gradual improvement in FMCG demand, making it a hold for now.
