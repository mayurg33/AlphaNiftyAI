After analyzing the recent headlines about NTPC, I would suggest:

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The news sentiment is overall positive, driven by the subsidiary NTPC Green Energy's plans for a large IPO, addition of 5 GW capacity in FY25, and its pact with Indus Towers for renewable energy projects, indicating growth potential and diversification in the clean energy space.
