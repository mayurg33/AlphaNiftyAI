Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While some brokerages, such as Motilal Oswal, are bullish on HCLTech with a target price of Rs 1700, the mixed Q4 results and weak FY25 guidance have led to a divided opinion among analysts, with some expecting near-term pressure on the stock. Holding the stock seems like a prudent decision until there is more clarity on the company's future prospects.
