Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the Q4 results were disappointing with a 41% drop in net profit, the management's turnaround plan and positive developments such as being recognized as a market leader in customer experience services and plans to hire 6,000 freshers in FY25 suggest a potential upswing, warranting a hold decision.
