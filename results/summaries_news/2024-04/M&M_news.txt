Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the fraud detection and delay in Q4 results are negative news, the company's Q4 disbursement numbers are strong, and the NII is expected to rise 11%. Additionally, the asset quality is expected to improve, and the company's foray into hybrid renewable energy is a positive development, which balances out the negative news.
