Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent news sentiment around ULTRACEMCO is mixed, with positive Q4 results and a dividend declaration, but also sluggish realisations and declining stock price. However, analysts are optimistic about the company's growth prospects, including double-digit growth targets for FY26 and potential price hikes, which suggests a HOLD position for now.
