Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The news sentiment around ONGC is mixed, with positive news on the company's green energy capacity push and the government's hike in APM gas prices, which could benefit ONGC, being offset by negative news on crude oil output drops and the recent tumble in ONGC's shares due to a surprise OPEC+ output hike.
