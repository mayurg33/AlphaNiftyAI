Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While TCS has demonstrated resilience by crossing the $30 billion revenue milestone and posting a strong order book, its Q4 results have been impacted by lower IT spending from clients, resulting in net income trailing estimates. However, the company's dividend payout and deal wins provide some comfort, and a HOLD decision is recommended until there is more clarity on the demand environment and the company's ability to navigate the challenges.
