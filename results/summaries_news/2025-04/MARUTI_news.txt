Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the Q4 results show a slight dip in profit, the company has reported its highest-ever annual profit in FY24 and has declared a highest-ever dividend, indicating strong financial performance and stability. The mixed news sentiment, with some analysts maintaining a "Buy" rating and others highlighting the decline in profit, suggests a hold position until further clarity emerges.
