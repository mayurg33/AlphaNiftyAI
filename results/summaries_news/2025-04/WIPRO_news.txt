Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Wipro reported a 25.9% increase in net profit, its cautious Q1FY26 forecast and weak revenue growth guidance have led to a downgrade by brokerages, causing the stock to drop 6%. However, the company's strong Q4 results and 26% YoY profit jump suggest that it may be worth holding onto for now, pending further evaluation of its future performance.
