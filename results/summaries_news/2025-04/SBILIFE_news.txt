Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite a flat Q4 FY25 net profit and a 5% decline in net premium income, SBI Life showed a 27% increase in FY25 PAT and the company is eyeing stronger growth in FY26 led by agency business expansion, indicating a positive outlook. The stock has received a positive response from the market, with a significant rise in share price, and has been recommended by analysts for the next week.
