Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Axis Bank's Q4 results beat estimates, the stock price sank 4% due to a weak growth outlook, and there are mixed brokerage calls. Holding the stock allows for a wait-and-watch approach to see how the bank's fundraising efforts and potential stake sale in Axis Finance play out.
