Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is POSITIVE for Kotak Mahindra Bank's stock.

Notable events:

* The bank's Q4 earnings report led to a nearly 5% increase in its shares, indicating a strong market response to the earnings announcement.
* However, the news about rising IT expenses and customer complaints might have tempered the positive sentiment to some extent.

The overall tone of the news is positive, driven primarily by the strong Q4 earnings report. The historical data suggests that positive earnings reports have generally led to a positive impact on the stock price, with an average impact of around +1.5%. The news about rising customer complaints is a concern, but it seems to be overshadowed by the positive earnings report.

It's worth noting that the historical data also suggests that the market can be sensitive to negative news about the bank, such as profit drops or controversies, which can lead to a negative impact on the stock price. However, in this case, the positive earnings report seems to be the dominant factor driving the sentiment.
