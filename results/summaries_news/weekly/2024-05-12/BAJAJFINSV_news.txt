The notable event is that two Bajaj companies have raised a record Rs 12,000 crore debt on a single day as yields fall, which is a significant achievement.

The news tone is positive for the stock because it indicates that the companies are able to access a large amount of debt at favorable terms, which can be beneficial for their business operations and growth. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price, similar to the 2021-06-01 news where Bajaj Auto's stock price increased by 3.78% after reporting a 114% jump in sales.
