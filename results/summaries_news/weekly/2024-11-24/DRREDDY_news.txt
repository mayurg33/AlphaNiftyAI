Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed to negative for the stocks mentioned.

Notable events:

* Dr. Reddy's Labs faced a setback with the USFDA issuing seven observations to its Hyderabad manufacturing plant, leading to a 3% decline in its stock price.
* Dr. Reddy's and Aurobindo Pharma signed MoUs with the Telangana Government for new pharma city facilities, which could be a positive development for the companies.

The news tone is:

* Negative for Dr. Reddy's Labs due to the USFDA observations and the subsequent decline in its stock price.
* Neutral for Aurobindo Pharma, as the MoU signing is a positive development, but the impact is not significant enough to outweigh the negative sentiment around Dr. Reddy's Labs.
* Neutral for the other stocks mentioned (Adani Group, Wipro, UPL, Bharti Airtel, Tata Power, PSP Projects, and Garden Reach Shipbuilders), as there are no significant positive or negative events reported.

Overall, the news tone is leaning towards being negative, primarily due to the Dr. Reddy's Labs incident.
