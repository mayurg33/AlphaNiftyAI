**Weekly News Sentiment:** Positive

**Notable Events:** Almost all banks have reported strong Q2 earnings, surpassing estimates.

**News Tone:** The news tone is overwhelmingly positive, indicating a bullish sentiment for the banking sector. The historical similar news articles suggest that when banks top estimates, the stock prices tend to rise, with an average impact of around 2.5%. The only exception is a single article from 2021, which had a negative impact, but it was related to a specific comparison of FD rates among banks, rather than a broader earnings report. Overall, the current news tone is likely to have a positive impact on banking stocks.
