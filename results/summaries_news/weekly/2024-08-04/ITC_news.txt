The current week's news sentiment for ITC is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

Notable events:

* ITC's Q1 results were announced, with net profit rising marginally to Rs 4,917 crore, but missing estimates.
* Revenue grew 7.5%, driven by a 2% volume growth.
* Motilal Oswal has recommended buying ITC with a target price of Rs 575.

The news tone is neutral to slightly negative due to the following reasons:

* The Q1 results missed estimates, which is a negative sentiment.
* The revenue growth of 7.5% is a positive, but the volume growth of 2% is a relatively slow pace.
* The recommendation by Motilal Oswal to buy ITC is a positive, but it is offset by the negative sentiment around the Q1 results.
* The historical data suggests that ITC's stock price has been volatile, with both positive and negative impacts from similar news events.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to slightly negative, indicating that the stock may experience some downward pressure in the short term. However, the recommendation by Motilal Oswal and the revenue growth may provide some support to the stock.
