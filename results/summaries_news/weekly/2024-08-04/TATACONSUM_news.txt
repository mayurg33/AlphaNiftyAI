Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL to NEGATIVE for Tata Consumer's stock.

The notable event is that FMCG distributors have raised concerns over Tata Consumer's acquisition of Capital Foods. This news may have a negative impact on the stock as it could lead to potential disruptions in the distribution channel and affect the company's sales.

The historical similar news and price impact suggest that the market has reacted positively to Tata Consumer's ability to navigate macro challenges in the past, but negatively to HUL's exit from certain businesses. However, the impact of this current news on the stock price is uncertain and may depend on the specifics of the acquisition and the concerns raised by the distributors.

Overall, the news tone is cautious and may lead to a short-term decline in the stock price.
