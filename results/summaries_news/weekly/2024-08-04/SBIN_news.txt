Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL for SBI stock.

Notable events:

* SBI is expected to report flat earnings on August 3, which may not have a significant impact on the stock price.
* SBI and Canara Bank are planning to raise Rs 19,000 crore via bonds, which could be a positive development for the bank.

Historical analysis suggests that SBI's quarterly results have had a mixed impact on the stock price in the past. While the stock has rallied significantly in some instances, it has also seen a decline in others.

The news tone is neutral because the expected flat earnings may not have a significant impact on the stock price, and the bond issuance plan could be a positive development. However, the overall sentiment is not overwhelmingly positive or negative.
