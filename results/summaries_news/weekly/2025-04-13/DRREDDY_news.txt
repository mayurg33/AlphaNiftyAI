Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed.

The first news article, "Here's why Dr. Reddy's share slipped 8%, hit 52-week low on Monday, April 7", has a negative tone, indicating a decline in the stock price.

On the other hand, the second news article, "Kyndryl partners with Dr. Reddyâ€™s Laboratories to implement advanced IT solutions", has a neutral to positive tone, suggesting a potential partnership that could benefit the company.

Notable events include Dr. Reddy's share price hitting a 52-week low and the partnership with Kyndryl to implement advanced IT solutions.

Overall, the news tone is leaning towards being neutral, with one negative article and one neutral to positive article. However, the negative article's impact on the stock price is more significant, which might outweigh the positive effect of the partnership news.
