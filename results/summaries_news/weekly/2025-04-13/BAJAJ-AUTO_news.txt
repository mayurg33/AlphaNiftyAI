2. Former Bajaj Auto vice-chairman Madhur Bajaj passes away at 73, which is a neutral to slightly negative event.

**Analysis:**

The partnership between Tunwal E-Motors and Bajaj Finance is a positive development, as it provides customers with easier access to loans and can potentially boost sales for Tunwal E-Motors. Historically, similar partnerships have had a positive impact on the stock price, with a notable example being BYD India's partnership with Bajaj Finance, which resulted in a 1.44% increase in stock price.

On the other hand, the passing of former Bajaj Auto vice-chairman Madhur Bajaj is a neutral to slightly negative event. While it is a sad occasion, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's operations or stock price. Historically, similar events have had a minimal impact on the stock price, with a negligible decrease of -0.09% in the case of Rahul Bajaj's passing.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to positive, with the positive development of the partnership between Tunwal E-Motors and Bajaj Finance outweighing the neutral to slightly negative event of Madhur Bajaj's passing.
