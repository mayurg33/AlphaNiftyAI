Based on the historical news and price impact, I summarize the current week's news sentiment as follows:

**News Sentiment:** Neutral to Positive

**Notable Events:**

1. RIL shares have slid 7% in a month, raising concerns about the future performance of India's largest company by market capitalization.
2. CLSA, a brokerage firm, has highlighted what the stock market is ignoring and predicts a 70% upside in RIL shares, citing the potential of Reliance Jio's IPO.

**Tone Analysis:**

The news tone is neutral to positive, as one article highlights the decline in RIL shares, while the other article presents a bullish outlook from CLSA. The historical news and price impact suggest that positive news and analyst recommendations have led to significant price increases in the past. Therefore, the overall tone is more positive, indicating that the stock may recover from its recent decline.
