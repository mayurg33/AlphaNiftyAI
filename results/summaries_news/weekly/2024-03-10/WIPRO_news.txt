Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed.

Notable events:

* Wipro's healthcare deals are getting an artificial intelligence (AI) booster shot, which could be a positive development for the company.
* Wipro is also making progress in its business insights journey with Microsoft Data Lake, which could lead to improved operational efficiency and decision-making.

However, the first news article "Excited about Wipro's stock? Beware â€“ it faces challenges galore" suggests that the company is facing challenges, which could be a negative factor for the stock.

Historical analysis suggests that news about Wipro's partnerships and awards (e.g., Microsoft Partner of the Year Award) have had a positive impact on the stock price in the past. On the other hand, news about challenges and competition (e.g., comparison with TCS and Infosys) have had a negative impact.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, with both positive and negative developments mentioned. The positive news about AI and Microsoft Data Lake could be offset by the challenges mentioned in the first article.
