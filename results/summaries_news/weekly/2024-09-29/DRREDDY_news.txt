**Weekly News Sentiment:** Negative

**Notable Events:**

1. UBS recommends selling Dr. Reddy's, Lupin, Zydus Life, and Auro Pharma shares, expecting up to 20% downside.
2. Dr. Reddy's invests $620 million in its Swiss subsidiary for the Nicotinell brand acquisition.

**News Tone:** Negative

The news tone is predominantly negative, driven by UBS's bearish recommendation on Dr. Reddy's and other pharma stocks, citing potential downside risks. Although Dr. Reddy's investment in its Swiss subsidiary for the Nicotinell brand acquisition is a significant event, it is not enough to offset the negative sentiment generated by UBS's recommendation. Overall, the news tone is negative, which may impact the stock's performance in the short term.
