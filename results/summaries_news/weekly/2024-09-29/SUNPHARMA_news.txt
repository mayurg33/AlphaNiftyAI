Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed to negative for the pharmaceutical stocks mentioned.

Notable events:

* Sun Pharma's trading volume has soared, which could be a positive sign for traders.
* UBS has recommended selling shares of Dr Reddy's, Lupin, Zydus Life, and Auro Pharma, citing up to 20% downside, which is a negative sentiment.
* CDSCO has flagged 53 drugs for quality failures, putting Sun Pharma, Glenmark, and Alkem Labs under scrutiny, which is a negative event.

Overall, the news tone is more negative than positive, with two out of three news items having a negative impact. The UBS sell recommendation and the CDSCO scrutiny are likely to weigh on investor sentiment, while the increase in Sun Pharma's trading volume may provide some support. However, the historical data suggests that the impact of these events may be limited, with the average impact ranging from -2.15% to +0.67%.
