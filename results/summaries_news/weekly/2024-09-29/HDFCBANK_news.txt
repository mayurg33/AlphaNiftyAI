Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed, but leaning towards being positive for HDFC Bank's stock.

Notable events:

* A Macquarie Report suggests that HDFC Bank's loan growth in Q2 could dip below 10%, which could be a negative sentiment.
* However, the bank's board has approved the proposed IPO of HDB Financial Services, which is a positive development.

Historical context:

* In the past, news about HDFC Bank's growth potential, credit growth, and IPO plans have had a positive impact on the stock, with price increases ranging from 0.04% to 4.02%.
* However, news about short-term challenges and limited growth have also had a positive impact, albeit to a lesser extent.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to positive, as the positive development of the IPO approval outweighs the potential negative impact of the loan growth dip. The stock is likely to experience a slight increase or remain stable in the short term.
