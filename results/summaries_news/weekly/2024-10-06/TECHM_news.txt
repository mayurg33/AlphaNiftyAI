Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL. The news headline "IT services firms likely to see modest growth in Q2 FY25" suggests a moderate outlook for the industry, without any strong positive or negative implications.

There are no notable events mentioned in the current week's news, as it appears to be a general industry outlook rather than a specific company-related announcement.

Comparing this to historical similar news, we can see that the impact of such news on stock prices has been varied. In the past, positive news such as deal wins (e.g., HCL Technologies and TCS) has led to a positive impact on stock prices (+1.25% and +1.13%, respectively). On the other hand, a general industry outlook (e.g., "IT giants TCS, Accenture, Cognizant lead Indian firms amid digital boom") has led to a negative impact (-2.58%). Given the modest growth outlook mentioned in the current week's news, the impact on stock prices is likely to be neutral or mildly positive.
