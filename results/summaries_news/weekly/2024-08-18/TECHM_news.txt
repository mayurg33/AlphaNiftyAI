Based on the historical similar news, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL.

The news about Tech Mahindra and LivePerson partnering to power AI-driven customer experience in financial services, healthcare, and life sciences is a notable event. However, the historical similar news suggests that the impact on the stock price is uncertain.

The historical news with a similar theme shows a mixed impact on the stock price. For instance, Tech Mahindra's partnership with Yellow.ai had a negative impact (-1.73%), while SBI's unveiling of a next-gen contact centre service had a positive impact (+1.17%). Another news about Tech Mahindra's acquisition of Activus Connect had a relatively neutral impact (-0.21%).

Therefore, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of the current news on the stock price. However, the partnership with LivePerson is a positive development for Tech Mahindra, and it may have a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price.
