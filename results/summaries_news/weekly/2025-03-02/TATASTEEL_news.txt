Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

Notable events: The news mentions top stocks to buy, which is a positive sentiment. However, the historical similar news and price impact suggest that the stock prices may not necessarily increase. In fact, two out of the three historical instances show a negative impact on stock prices (-1.79% and -2.52%).

The only positive instance (+4.35%) is related to a specific stock pick (Maruti) and not a general "top stocks to buy" recommendation.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to slightly negative, indicating that investors should exercise caution and not solely rely on this news to make investment decisions.
