Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL for Unilever's stock.

The notable event is the departure of Unilever's chief, Schumacher, after a 2-year stint, and the elevation of the CFO to the top position.

The historical data suggests that the impact of a CFO change on the stock price can be varied. In one instance, the resignation of a CFO led to a -2.22% decline in the stock price, while in another instance, the condolence of a former CFO's demise led to a +2.31% increase in the stock price. In a third instance, the appointment of a new CFO led to a -0.31% decline in the stock price.

Given the mixed historical data, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of this news on Unilever's stock price. However, the neutral tone suggests that the market may not react strongly to this news, and the stock price may not be significantly affected in the short term.
