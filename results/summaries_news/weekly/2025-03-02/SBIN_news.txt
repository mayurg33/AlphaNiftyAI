Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEGATIVE. The notable event is that InCred Equities has downgraded SBI's rating to 'Hold', causing the share price to hit a 52-week low. This downgrade suggests that the brokerage firm has a bearish outlook on the stock, which is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.

In contrast, historical news suggests that upgrades and positive outlooks from brokerages like Jefferies have led to a positive impact on the stock price (+4.55%). However, other news articles with neutral or mixed tones have led to a negative impact on the stock price (-2.06% and -2.86%). Overall, the current week's news tone is negative, indicating a potential decline in the stock price.
