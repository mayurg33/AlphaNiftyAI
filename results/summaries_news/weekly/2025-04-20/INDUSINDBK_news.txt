**Weekly News Sentiment:** Positive

**Notable Events:**

1. IndusInd Bank shares jumped 6% and 7% on two separate occasions due to a lower-than-expected impact from an audit of its derivatives portfolio.
2. The bank appointed Santosh Kumar as Deputy CFO.
3. An external probe found a â‚¹1,979-crore worth lapse in derivatives, which will result in a 2.27% hit to the bank's net worth.

**News Tone:** The overall news tone is positive for the stock. The market reacted positively to the lower-than-expected impact from the derivatives portfolio audit, leading to a significant jump in share prices. The appointment of a new Deputy CFO is a neutral event, but it adds to the overall positive sentiment. The news about the net worth hit is negative, but the market has already factored it in, and the share price has reacted positively to the lower-than-expected impact.

The historical similar news and price impact suggest that the market tends to react positively to news related to IndusInd Bank's management appointments and negatively to news related to its financial performance. However, in this week's news, the positive news about the derivatives portfolio audit has outweighed the negative news about the net worth hit, leading to an overall positive sentiment for the stock.
