The current week's news sentiment for Reliance Industries is NEUTRAL.

The notable event is the announcement of Q4 earnings, dividend, and fundraising plan on April 25.

The historical similar news shows a mixed impact on the stock price. In one instance, the stock price increased by 0.70% when the company turned ex-dividend, while in another instance, the stock price decreased by 5.62% post-earnings announcement. However, the third instance is not directly related to Reliance Industries but shows a positive impact of 3.37% on SBI shares after in-line quarterly results.
