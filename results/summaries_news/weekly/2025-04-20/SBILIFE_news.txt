Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is POSITIVE for the recommended stocks.

Notable events:

* Rajesh Palviya of Axis Sec recommends SBI Life, Indian Bank, and Adani Ports shares for the next week.

The news tone is positive because the historical data shows that similar recommendations from Axis Sec and other experts have led to positive price impacts in the past. Specifically, the previous recommendation of SBI Life by Axis Bank and GAIL experts resulted in a 1.50% increase, and even a negative commentary on Adani group by Deepak Shenoy led to a 0.64% increase. This suggests that the market responds positively to expert opinions and recommendations, which bodes well for the recommended stocks in the current week.
