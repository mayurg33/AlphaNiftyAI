Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL for Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Notable events:

* The bank's MD and CEO emphasized the importance of technology in transforming and scaling the business.
* The bank acknowledged that it needs to do more to leverage technology.

The news tone is neutral because the two news articles have contrasting sentiments. The first article, "Kotak Mahindra Bank says it has to do more to leverage technology", has a neutral tone, as it simply states the bank's acknowledgement of the need to improve its technology. The second article, "Tech centre of our efforts to transform, scale: Kotak Mahindra Bank MD, CEO", has a more positive tone, as it highlights the bank's efforts to transform and scale its business through technology.

Historical data suggests that news related to technology and transformation has had both positive and negative impacts on the stock price in the past. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of these news articles on the stock price. However, overall, the neutral tone of the news suggests that the stock price may not be significantly affected in either direction.
