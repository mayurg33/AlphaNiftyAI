**Weekly News Sentiment: Negative**

The current week's news sentiment is predominantly negative for Oil India and ONGC shares. The notable events that contributed to this sentiment are:

1. **Crude price crash**: OPEC+'s surprise output hike led to a tumble in Oil India and ONGC shares, with a potential impact of -6%.
2. **APM gas price hike**: The 4% increase in APM gas prices is expected to raise costs for CNG, fertilizers, and electricity, which may negatively impact the companies.
3. **Focus on gas stocks**: Although the APM gas price hike may benefit gas stocks, the historical data suggests a mixed impact, with both positive and negative effects.

The only positive news is ONGC seeking shareholder approval for key Mozambique energy ventures, but its historical impact is relatively neutral.

Overall, the news tone is **negative** for the stock, driven by the crude price crash and APM gas price hike, which may lead to increased costs and decreased profitability for Oil India and ONGC.
