**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral

**Notable Event:** The Coal India Chairman reviewed the performance of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL), a subsidiary of Coal India.

**News Tone:** The news tone is neutral as it is a routine review of performance and does not provide any specific information about the company's financials, production, or sales. The review could be a positive or negative assessment, but without further details, it is difficult to determine the impact on the stock.

Historical context suggests that news related to coal production and availability can have a positive impact on the stock (e.g., +1.81% on 2022-07-03), while news about coal allocation to power producers can have a negative impact (e.g., -4.27% on 2021-10-11). However, in this case, the news is too vague to determine a clear sentiment.
