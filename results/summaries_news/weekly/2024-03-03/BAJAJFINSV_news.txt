Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL.

The notable event is the launch of Project ODISERV by Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, which is a positive development. However, the historical data suggests that the impact of such news on the stock price is inconsistent. In the past, similar news related to the petroleum minister has had both positive and negative impacts on the stock price.

The positive impact of +2.69% was seen when the Maha Vikas Aghadi sought the Union Petroleum Minister's resignation, which might not be directly related to the launch of Project ODISERV. On the other hand, the news about NTPC inviting EOI to produce torrefied biomass pellets from Startups had a negative impact of -6.65%, which might not be directly comparable to the current news.

The only somewhat comparable news is the launch of software by Coal India Limited for better assessment of coal resources, which had a positive impact of +1.57%. However, the impact is relatively mild compared to the other two historical events.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, and the impact on the stock price is uncertain. It would be wise to monitor the stock's performance and wait for further developments before making any investment decisions.
