The current week's news sentiment is Positive. The notable event is Fitch upgrading Shriram Finance's rating due to an improved business profile. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock, similar to the historical instances where Fitch upgrades led to a positive price impact, such as +0.97% for Reliance Industries and +0.95% for Axis Bank. However, it's worth noting that there is an outlier in the historical data, where Fitch's upgrade of TCS led to a -16.20% impact, but this seems to be an exception rather than the norm. Overall, the news tone is Positive for the stock.
