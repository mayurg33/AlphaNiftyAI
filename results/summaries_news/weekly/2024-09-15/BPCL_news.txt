Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is overall positive for the stock.

The news tone is positive, with all three news headlines conveying a sense of achievement and progress for BPCL and IOCL. The joint venture securing production rights in Abu Dhabi is a significant development, and the historical data suggests that such news has led to positive price impacts in the past.

Notable events mentioned in the historical data include BPCL's rights issue for clean energy transition and capital raise, which had a positive impact on the stock. Additionally, BPCL's conclusion of commercial terms for buying Oman stake in Bina Refinery and its acquisition of a stake in Bharat Oman Refineries also had positive impacts on the stock.

The only negative impact mentioned in the historical data is related to GAIL beating IOC to win a licence to build a gas pipeline, which had a negative impact on IOC's stock. However, this event is not directly related to BPCL or IOCL's joint venture in Abu Dhabi.

Overall, the news tone is positive, and investors may expect a positive price impact on BPCL and IOCL's stocks following this development.
