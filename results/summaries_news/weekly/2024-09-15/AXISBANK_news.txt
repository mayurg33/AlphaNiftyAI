Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL for both Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.

Notable events:

* RBI has fined Axis Bank and HDFC Bank for regulatory violations and non-compliance with directives.

Historical analysis suggests that similar news events have had a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock prices of these banks. In the past, RBI fines and penalties have not significantly affected the stock prices of these banks, and in some cases, have even led to a slight increase in stock prices.

The news tone is neutral because the fines and penalties imposed by RBI are not expected to have a significant impact on the banks' financial performance or operations. The banks have likely already provisioned for these fines, and the news is not expected to affect their business outlook or investor sentiment significantly.
