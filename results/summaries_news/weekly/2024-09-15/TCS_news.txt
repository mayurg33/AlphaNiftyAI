Historical context:

* In the past, TCS has had a mix of positive and negative price impacts from similar news. For example, the company's recognition as a UK Superbrand led to a 1% decline in stock price, while the expansion of its partnership with Phoenix Group resulted in a 1.85% increase. On the other hand, being named a Leader in Procurement Outsourcing by Everest Group led to a 1.41% decline.
