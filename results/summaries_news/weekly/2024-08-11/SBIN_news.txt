**Weekly News Sentiment:** Negative

The current week's news sentiment for SBI is negative, with three out of four news articles reporting a decline in the stock price. The news tone is primarily driven by the bank's Q1FY25 results, which led to a decline in the stock price.

**Notable Events:**

1. SBI's push into wealth management with vigor, which is a positive development for the bank.
2. The bank's Q1FY25 results, which led to a decline in the stock price due to lower deposit growth and mixed brokerage recommendations.

**News Tone:**

* Negative: 3 articles (SBI plunges over 3% on lower deposit growth, SBI share price falls over 3% after Q1FY25 results, Why SBI stock fell 5% after Q1 result?)
* Positive: 1 article (SBI pushes into wealth management with vigour as wealthy people surge)

The negative news tone is primarily driven by the bank's Q1FY25 results, which led to a decline in the stock price. However, the positive news about SBI's push into wealth management suggests that the bank is taking steps to diversify its revenue streams and tap into the growing wealth management market.
