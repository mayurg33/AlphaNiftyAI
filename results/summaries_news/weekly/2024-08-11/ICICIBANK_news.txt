Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL to POSITIVE for ICICI Bank.

The notable event is that ICICI Bank is among 7 stocks that will trade ex-dividend on Monday, which means that investors have a last chance to buy the stock today to be eligible for the dividend payout.

Historically, similar news has had a positive impact on the stock price, with a +4.52% increase in 2022 and a +1.40% increase in 2023, when ICICI Bank declared dividends. However, in 2021, the impact was slightly negative (-0.25%) when the news was more focused on the company's market share gains.

Overall, the tone of the news is encouraging, suggesting that investors may see this as an opportunity to buy the stock before it trades ex-dividend, which could lead to a positive price impact.
