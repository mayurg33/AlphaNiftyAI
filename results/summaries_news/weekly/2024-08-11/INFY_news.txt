Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is **Negative** for Infosys.

The notable event is that the Government of India has decided not to give any relaxation in its Rs 32,000 crore GST demand on Infosys, which is a significant amount and may put pressure on the company's financials.

Historically, similar news related to Infosys and the government has had a mixed impact on the stock price. While some news items, such as the FM's assurance to resolve technical glitches in the I-T portal, had a positive impact (+1.48%), others, like the correction in revenue forecast, had a negative impact (-8.16%). However, in this case, the news of the government not providing any relaxation in GST demand is likely to be perceived as negative for the stock.

Overall, the tone of the news is **Negative**, indicating potential downward pressure on Infosys' stock price.
