Based on the historical similar news, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE for ONGC's stock.

The notable event is ONGC seeking foreign partners for the Mumbai High oilfield due to falling output. This news may be perceived as a negative development, as it implies that the company is struggling to maintain production levels on its own.

The historical similar news suggests that news related to ONGC's oil prices and production has had a negative impact on the stock price in the past. For example, the news about the oil ministry telling ONGC to sell oilfields and hive off drilling services had a -1.49% impact on the stock price.

However, the recent news about ONGC getting a better price for oil under new rules had a relatively minor negative impact of -0.39%. This suggests that the market may not be overly concerned about ONGC's current struggles with output, as long as the company is able to secure better prices for its oil.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to slightly negative, indicating that investors may be cautious about ONGC's prospects in the short term, but are not overly bearish.
