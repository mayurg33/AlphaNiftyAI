Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE for ICICI Bank.

Notable events:

* ICICI Bank faces pushback against delisting its brokerage unit, ICICI Securities, which may indicate regulatory hurdles or opposition from stakeholders.
* Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) has rapped ICICI Bank on I-Sec investor outreach, implying that the bank may need to improve its investor communication and engagement.

The news tone is neutral to slightly negative because while the delisting proposal has received some positive reactions in the past (as seen in the historical similar news), the current pushback and Sebi's rap may create uncertainty and potential obstacles for the bank. However, it's worth noting that the historical similar news also shows that ICICI Bank's stock has been resilient and has even seen positive impacts in the past despite negative news.
