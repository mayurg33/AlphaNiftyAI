**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral to Slightly Positive

**Notable Events:**

1. HUL Q3 Results: The company reported a profit of Rs 3,001 crore, beating estimates, and revenue of Rs 15,408 crore.
2. Brokerages cut target prices on weak near-term demand outlook and urban slowdown.
3. HUL to acquire premium beauty brand Minimalist.
4. Demerger of Ice Cream Business.

**News Tone:**

The overall news tone for HUL is neutral to slightly positive. The Q3 results, which beat estimates, are a positive development. However, brokerages cutting target prices due to weak demand outlook and urban slowdown is a negative sentiment. The acquisition of Minimalist and demerger of Ice Cream Business are neutral events.

The historical data suggests that the stock price has been volatile in response to similar news events in the past. The impact of the current news on the stock price is likely to be moderate, with a possible short-term positive movement due to the strong Q3 results, but with caution due to the weak demand outlook.
