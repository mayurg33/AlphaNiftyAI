Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive for Elcid Investments. The notable event is the extraordinary return of 66,92,535% in a single day, which is unprecedented. Additionally, the stock has provided the best dividend yield in FY24, which is a significant achievement.

The news tone is extremely positive, indicating a strong bullish sentiment around the stock. The language used in the headline, such as "Not just" and "best dividend yield", emphasizes the exceptional performance of the stock.

In contrast, the historical similar news and price impact suggest that dividend-related news can sometimes have a negative impact on the stock price. However, in this case, the extraordinary return and dividend yield have likely overshadowed any potential negative sentiment.
