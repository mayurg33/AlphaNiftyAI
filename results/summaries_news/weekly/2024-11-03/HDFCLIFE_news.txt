Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL.

The news tone is neutral because both news headlines report the same event, which is HDFC Standard Life buying PNB Housing Finance's shares worth Rs 90 cr. This acquisition is a significant event, but the tone of the news is simply informative, without any emotional or sensational language.

Notable events: HDFC Standard Life's acquisition of a stake in PNB Housing Finance is the main event of the week.

Historical context: The historical news and price impact data suggest that HDFC-related news can have a significant impact on the stock price. In the past, positive news has led to a price increase of up to 5.04%, while negative news has led to a price decrease of up to 5.56%. However, in this case, the news tone is neutral, and the impact on the stock price is uncertain.
