The current week's news sentiment is positive. The notable event is that Infosys, TechM, and Wipro shares have reached a 52-week high, driven by hopes of a Fed rate cut. The Nifty IT index has also hit an all-time high. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock prices, as it indicates a bullish trend in the IT sector.

Historical similar news suggests that when these IT stocks recover from 52-week lows or hit new highs, the impact on the stock price is generally positive.

Overall, the news tone is positive for the stock, indicating a potential upward trend in the short term.
