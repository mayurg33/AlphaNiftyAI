Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed.

The first news "Buy Reliance Industries, target price Rs 1,580: Motilal Oswal Financial Services" suggests a positive tone, as it recommends buying the stock with a target price of Rs 1,580. This is similar to previous instances where Motilal Oswal has reiterated its faith in Reliance Industries, resulting in a positive impact on the stock price.

On the other hand, the second news "Reliance Industries Ltd down for fifth straight session" suggests a negative tone, as it implies a decline in the stock price. This is similar to previous instances where Reliance Industries' shares have tumbled, resulting in a negative impact on the stock price.

Notable events include the recommendation by Motilal Oswal to buy Reliance Industries and the stock's decline for the fifth straight session.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, as it is a mix of positive and negative sentiments. However, if I had to lean towards one side, I would say it's slightly negative due to the stock's decline for five straight sessions.
