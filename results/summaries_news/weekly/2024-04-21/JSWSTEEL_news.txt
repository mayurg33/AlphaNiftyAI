Based on the historical similar news, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE for the steel stocks.

The news "India's steelmakers fall short of investment target due to delays linked to China" suggests that the steel industry in India is facing challenges in meeting its investment targets, which could impact the sector's growth. This news may have a slightly negative impact on the stock prices.

However, it's worth noting that the historical similar news suggests that steel stocks have been attractive buys in the past, and the sector has shown resilience. The news about India becoming the third-largest economy in 2029 and ArcelorMittal's investment plans in Odisha also have a positive tone.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to slightly negative, but the historical context suggests that the steel sector has the potential to bounce back.
