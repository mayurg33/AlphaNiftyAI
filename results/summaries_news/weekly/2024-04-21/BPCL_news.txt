**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral to Negative

**Notable Events:**

1. Israel-Iran tensions led to a decline in OMC stocks, including BPCL, IOC, and HPCL, on Friday, April 19.
2. BPCL signed a deal with Noida International Airport to build a 34-Km ATF pipeline, which is expected to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
3. Weaker economic data outweighed Middle-East tensions, leading to a gain in BPCL, HPCL, and IOC shares.

**News Tone:**

The overall news tone for BPCL is neutral to negative. While the deal with Noida International Airport and the gain in shares due to weaker economic data are positive developments, the impact of Israel-Iran tensions on OMC stocks and the decline in shares due to various factors (e.g., high fuel prices, weak crude) weigh down the sentiment. The historical similar news and price impact analysis also suggests a mixed sentiment, with some positive and negative impacts on the stock price.
