Based on the historical similar news, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL for Yes Bank.

The news report states that Yes Bank is seeking a new promoter and is eyeing a valuation of $8-9 billion. This news is notable as it indicates a potential change in the bank's ownership structure and a significant increase in its valuation.

The historical similar news shows mixed sentiments. The RBI's approval of Hinduja hiking IndusInd Bank stake had a negative impact (-6.87%), while the RBI allowing promoters to have 26% stake had a positive impact (+4.85%). The comparison of Yes Bank's valuation with IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank had a slightly negative impact (-1.17%).

Overall, the news tone is neutral as it is unclear how the market will react to the potential change in Yes Bank's ownership structure and valuation. The impact could be positive if the new promoter brings in fresh capital and expertise, or negative if the transition is not smooth or if the valuation is not justified.
