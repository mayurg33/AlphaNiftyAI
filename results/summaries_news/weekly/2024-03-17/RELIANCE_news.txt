Based on the historical similar news and price impact, here is a summary of the current week's news sentiment for Reliance Industries:

**News Sentiment:** Positive

**Notable Events:**

1. Reliance Industries shares climb over 1% after Paramount Global deal, indicating a positive impact on the stock.
2. Reliance-linked Qwik Supply Chain emerges from shadow, which could be a positive development for the company.
3. Confirmed: A Reliance Group company donated Rs 410 crores through electoral bonds, which might have a neutral to negative impact on the stock.

**Tone:** Overall, the news tone is positive for the stock, driven by the positive impact of the Paramount Global deal and the emergence of Qwik Supply Chain. However, the news about electoral bonds might have a slightly negative tone, but it seems to be outweighed by the positive news.

The historical similar news and price impact suggest that the stock has responded positively to news related to deals and partnerships, as well as subsidiary news. The negative impact of the electoral bonds news is likely to be limited, given the overall positive tone of the other two news items.
