Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL for SBI stock.

Notable events:

* SBI has partnered with Paytm for its UPI business, which could enhance its digital payment capabilities.
* There is a comparison between SBI and Bank of Baroda as a long-term investment option, with no clear consensus on which one is better.
