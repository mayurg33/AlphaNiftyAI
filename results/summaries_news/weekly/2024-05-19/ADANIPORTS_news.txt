Similarly, when Adani Ports shares fell in the past, the impact was significant, with one instance showing a decline of -19.54%. The exclusion from Norway's government pension fund also had a positive impact in the past, but it's unlikely to offset the negative sentiment from the other two news articles.

Overall, the news tone is negative for Adani Ports, and investors may exercise caution due to the mixed sentiment and historical data suggesting significant price impacts.
