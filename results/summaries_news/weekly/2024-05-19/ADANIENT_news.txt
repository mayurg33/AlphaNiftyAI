Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment for Adani Enterprises is NEUTRAL.

The news tone is neutral because the historical data shows a mix of positive and negative price impacts. The positive impact of +44.58% on 2023-03-03 suggests that the market reacted favorably to GQG Partners' overweight stance on India, which included Adani Enterprises as a top holding. On the other hand, the negative impact of -0.70% on 2023-07-10 indicates that the market was cautious due to the Sebi affidavit filing in the Supreme Court.

The current news about Adani firm eyeing Rs 80,000 capex in FY25 is a notable event, but its impact is uncertain. The capex plan could be seen as a positive development, indicating the company's growth ambitions and potential for future earnings growth. However, it may also raise concerns about the company's debt levels and funding requirements.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, and the market's reaction to this news will depend on how investors weigh the potential benefits and risks of the capex plan.
