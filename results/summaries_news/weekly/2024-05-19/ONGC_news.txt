Based on the historical similar news and price impact, here is a summary of the current week's news sentiment:

**News Sentiment:** Neutral to Negative

**Notable Events:**

1. ONGC is expected to report dull earnings in Q4 due to flattish realization and sales volume, which may negatively impact the stock price.
2. Jefferies has given a buy rating to ONGC with a target price for 2024, which could be a positive signal for investors.

**Tone Analysis:**

The tone of the news is neutral to negative, as the Q4 results preview is expected to be dull, which may lead to a negative impact on the stock price. However, the buy rating from Jefferies and the dividend history of ONGC may provide some support to the stock. Overall, the news tone is more cautious and neutral, with a slight negative bias.

It's worth noting that the historical data suggests that ONGC's stock price has been positively impacted by improved outlook and dividend declarations in the past. However, the current news tone is more subdued, and the market's reaction to the Q4 results will be crucial in determining the stock's direction.
