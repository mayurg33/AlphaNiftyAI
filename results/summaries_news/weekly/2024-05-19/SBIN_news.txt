Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL.

Notable events:

* State Bank of India (SBI) cuts its headcount by 25,000 in five years, which could be seen as a cost-cutting measure but may also raise concerns about job losses.
* SBI becomes the first bank to become a trading and clearing member of India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX), which could be a positive development for the bank's business.
* The Finance Ministry asks SBI to form a committee to tackle co-lending issues, which may indicate that the government is taking steps to address concerns in the banking sector.

Historical analysis suggests that news about SBI's efficiency and corporate loans has had a mixed impact on the stock price, with both positive and negative reactions. The news about SBI becoming a trading and clearing member of IIBX has historically had a positive impact on the stock price.

Overall, the current week's news tone is neutral, as it contains both positive and negative developments. The headcount reduction may be seen as a negative, while the IIBX membership and the government's initiative to address co-lending issues could be viewed as positives.
