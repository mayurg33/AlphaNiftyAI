**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to negative for Nestle India's stock. The rejection of higher royalty payments to its parent company might be seen as a positive move by shareholders, but the historical data suggests that such news has had a negative impact on the stock price in the past. The average impact of similar news in the past has been around -1.5%. However, the positive market trend and the Sensex's gain might offset some of the negative sentiment.

It's worth noting that the news tone is more neutral for the broader market, with the Sensex ending a special trading session above 74,000 and Nestle India's stock rising 2%.
