**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral to Slightly Negative

**Notable Events:**

1. Britannia Industries announced its Q4 results, reporting a 3% drop in net profit to ₹538 crore, while revenue increased by 3% YoY.
2. The company declared a final dividend of ₹73 per share.
3. Multiple news outlets reported on Britannia's Q4 results, with varying headlines and profit figures (e.g., ₹536.6 crore, ₹537 crore).

**News Tone:**

The overall news tone is neutral to slightly negative. While the revenue growth and dividend declaration are positive developments, the decline in net profit might be a concern for investors. The historical data suggests that Britannia's stock price has reacted positively to dividend declarations in the past, but the impact of Q4 results has been mixed.

Based on the historical data, the average impact of Britannia's Q4 results on its stock price is around +0.2%, while the dividend declaration has a more significant positive impact, with an average of +1.5%. However, the current week's news tone is more subdued, likely due to the decline in net profit.
