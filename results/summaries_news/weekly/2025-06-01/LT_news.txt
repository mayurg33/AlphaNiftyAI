Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is neutral for Larsen & Toubro (L&T) stock.

Notable events:

* L&T will trade ex-dividend this week, which may have a positive impact on the stock price.
* MMRDA has sought a full financial breakdown from L&T after scrapping the Thane-Bhayander twin projects, which may have a negative impact.
* Shareholders may hold off on increasing CEO compensation, which may not have a significant impact on the stock price.
* L&T plans to raise Rs 500 crore via ESG bonds, which may have a positive impact.
* The company has bagged "major" orders for its power transmission and distribution business, which may have a positive impact.

The news tone is neutral because the positive news (ex-dividend, ESG bond issuance, and order wins) is balanced by the negative news (MMRDA seeking financial breakdown and potential hold on CEO compensation increase). Overall, the news does not seem to have a strong positive or negative bias, and the stock price may not be significantly impacted.
