Based on the historical similar news, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL.

Notable events:

* TCS is set to announce its Q4 results on April 12, which will be closely watched by investors.
* The focus will be on the company's guidance, dividend, and other key metrics.

The news tone is neutral because the historical similar news has shown both positive and negative price impacts. In the past, news about TCS's dividend and ex-dividend dates has led to both increases (+4.51%) and decreases (-3.19%) in the stock price. Therefore, it's difficult to predict the exact impact of the current news on the stock price.
