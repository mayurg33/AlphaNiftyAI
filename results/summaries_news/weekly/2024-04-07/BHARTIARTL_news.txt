**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral to Positive

**Notable Events:**

1. Bharti Hexacom's IPO has been subscribed 1.12 times on the second day of the offer, indicating a decent response from investors.
2. The IPO is the first public offer from the Bharti Group in over a decade, generating significant interest in the market.

**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to positive for the stock. The IPO subscription numbers are a positive development, indicating investor interest in the company. Additionally, the valuation of the government's stake in Bharti Hexacom at around Rs 3,100 crore and the valuation of TCIL's 30% stake at around Rs 8,900 crore are also positive news for the stock.

However, some historical news articles highlight the competitive landscape in the telecom industry, with Reliance Jio's market share and Vodafone Idea's performance being mentioned as potential concerns for Bharti Airtel and its subsidiary Bharti Hexacom. These articles have a negative impact on the stock.

Overall, the positive news around the IPO subscription and valuations outweigh the negative news, resulting in a neutral to positive tone for the stock.
