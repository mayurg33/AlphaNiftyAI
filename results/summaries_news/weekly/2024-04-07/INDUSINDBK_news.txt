The current week's news sentiment for IndusInd Bank is NEUTRAL. 

The news reports that deposits and advances have shown a healthy uptick, which is a positive development. However, the CASA (Current Account Savings Account) ratio remains flat, which might be a concern. 

Notable events from historical similar news include strong loan growth reported by HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, which had a positive impact on the stock price. On the other hand, rising funding costs weighed on private banks, leading to a negative impact on the stock price. 

Overall, the news tone is neutral, as the positive growth in deposits and advances is offset by the flat CASA ratio.
