Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed, with two positive news articles and one negative news article.

The negative news article, "Tech Mahindra's growth is still difficult, IT stock may fall over 23%: Citi", suggests that the stock may decline significantly, which is a bearish signal.

On the other hand, the two positive news articles, "TechM, Coforge, Tata Tech: 3 IT stocks that can deliver strong returns in short term" and "These 3 IT stocks could deliver quick gains in short term. Check here", suggest that Tech Mahindra and other IT stocks may deliver strong returns in the short term, which is a bullish signal.

Notable events include the mention of Tech Mahindra's growth challenges and the potential for the stock to fall, as well as the identification of Tech Mahindra and other IT stocks as potential winners in the short term.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, as the positive and negative news articles balance each other out. However, the negative article's bearish sentiment may have a slightly stronger impact on the stock's price, given the significant potential decline mentioned.
