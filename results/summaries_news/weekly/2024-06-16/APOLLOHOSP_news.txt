Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL to NEGATIVE.

The news about the newest Nifty 50 entrant reaching a market capitalization of â‚¹1 lakh crore does not seem to have a strong positive impact on the stock. Historically, similar news has resulted in a negative price impact, ranging from -1.29% to -6.53%. This suggests that the market may not be overly enthusiastic about this development.

Notable events mentioned in the historical news include the performance of Reliance and Adani Group stocks, LIC's increased shareholding in Tata Motors, and the impact of Covid-19 on corporate credit. These events may have contributed to the negative price impact, but it's unclear how they relate to the current news about the Nifty 50 entrant.

Overall, the news tone is cautious, and investors may be adopting a wait-and-see approach to assess the implications of this development on the stock's performance.
