Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive for Tata Steel's stock. The news tone is bullish, with both articles highlighting the stock's potential upside.

The first article, "Why Tata Steel Share Price is Rising", suggests that the stock is on an upward trend, and the second article, "10:1 Split, 360% Dividend: Tata's Steel Stock Hits New High, Big £1.25 Bn Deal Update; BUY For Rs 200 Target", reinforces this sentiment with a strong buy recommendation and a target price of Rs 200.

Notable events mentioned in the news include the 10:1 stock split, 360% dividend, and a big £1.25 billion deal update, which are all seen as positive catalysts for the stock.

Historical data suggests that similar news in the past has had a positive impact on the stock price, with an average impact of around +4.5%. The only negative impact was seen in 2022, but that was related to a post-merger slip in the stock price.

Overall, the current week's news tone is positive, and investors are likely to view it as a buying opportunity.
