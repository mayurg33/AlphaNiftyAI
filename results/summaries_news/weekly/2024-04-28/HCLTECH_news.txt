**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral to Negative

**Notable Events:**

1. HCL Tech Q4 results: Net profit flat at ₹3,986 crore, revenue rises 7% YoY.
2. HCLTech misses Q4 estimates, posts weak guidance for FY25.
3. ₹18 interim dividend declared.

**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to negative for HCL Tech stock. While the company's revenue growth of 7% YoY is a positive aspect, the flat net profit and weak guidance for FY25 are concerns. The dividend declaration is a positive event, but it may not be enough to offset the negative sentiment around the company's performance.

The historical similar news and price impact analysis suggests that the stock may react negatively to the weak guidance and profit miss, with potential price impacts ranging from -0.78% to -9.33%. However, the dividend declaration may provide some support to the stock, with potential price impacts ranging from +1.91% to +3.14%. Overall, the news tone is neutral to negative, and investors may exercise caution while making investment decisions.
