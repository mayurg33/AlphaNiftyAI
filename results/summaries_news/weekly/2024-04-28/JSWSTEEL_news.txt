Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL.

Notable events: Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities recommends three stocks: Firstsource Solutions, Canara Bank, and JSW Steel.

The news tone is neutral because the historical similar news has shown mixed results. While one instance had a positive impact (+5.13%), the other two instances had negative impacts (-1.91% and -2.66%). This suggests that the recommendation by Rajesh Palviya may not have a significant or consistent impact on the stock prices.
