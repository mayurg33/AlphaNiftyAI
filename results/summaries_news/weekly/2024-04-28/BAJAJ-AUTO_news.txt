**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral

**Notable Events:** Bajaj Auto plans to invest INR 800 crore in FY25 and will launch its upcoming CNG bike in phases.

**News Tone:** Neutral

The news tone is neutral as it doesn't convey a strong positive or negative sentiment. The investment plan of INR 800 crore in FY25 could be seen as a positive sign, indicating the company's commitment to growth and expansion. However, the lack of specific details about the CNG bike launch and its potential impact on the company's sales and revenue makes it difficult to determine a clear positive or negative tone.

Historical data suggests that the stock has responded positively to new product launches, such as the Platina 100 Electric Start and Platina 110, with a price impact of +1.43% in both cases. On the other hand, a price cut, like the one seen in the Dominar 250, had a negative impact of -4.67%. However, these historical events are not directly comparable to the current news, and therefore, the overall sentiment remains neutral.
