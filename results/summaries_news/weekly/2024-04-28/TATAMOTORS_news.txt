Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE for Tata Motors DVR.

The notable event is the concern expressed by Tata Motors DVR investors over the 30% discount for conversion, which may have a negative impact on the stock price.

However, it's worth noting that the historical data shows that Tata Motors DVR has been resilient to negative news, and the stock has even surged in response to certain announcements (e.g., +2.66% on 2021-11-09). The recent news may not have a significant impact on the stock price, and the sentiment could turn positive if the company addresses the concerns of its DVR investors.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to slightly negative, but the stock's historical performance suggests that it may be able to bounce back from any potential negative impact.
