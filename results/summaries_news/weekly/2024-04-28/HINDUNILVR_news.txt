**News Tone:**

The overall news tone is neutral to negative for HUL's stock. While the company's Q4 results were in line with estimates, the dip in net profit and muted volume growth may have disappointed investors. The announcement of a final dividend of Rs 24 per share may have provided some comfort, but the focus on six key categories to spur growth may not have been enough to lift the sentiment.

The historical data suggests that similar news events have had a negative impact on the stock price, with an average impact of around -2% to -3%. However, there are some positive news events that have had a positive impact on the stock price, such as the company's focus on growth initiatives and dividend announcements.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to negative, and investors may be cautious about the stock's performance in the short term.
