Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL.

The two news articles report that Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is considering the sale of its Pureit water purifier business. This news does not have a clear positive or negative tone, as it is more of a strategic business decision rather than a performance or earnings-related announcement.

Notable events from the historical similar news include HUL's announcement of becoming coal-free, which had a positive impact of +0.40% on the stock price. Additionally, the company's profit jump in early 2021 due to a shopping surge had a positive impact of +1.28%. However, there were also some negative news events, such as brokerages being bullish on HUL but the stock price dropping by -2.69%, and the company's CFO commenting on navigating inflationary commodity costs, which had a negative impact of -1.75%.

Overall, the current week's news tone is neutral, as the sale of Pureit is a strategic decision that may have both positive and negative implications for the company.
