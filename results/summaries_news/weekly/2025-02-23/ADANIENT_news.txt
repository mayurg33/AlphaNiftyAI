Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed, with both positive and negative news affecting the Adani group stocks.

Notable events:

* Adani group stocks fell up to 4% due to various reasons, including the US SEC seeking India's help in a fraud probe.
* The group reported its highest-ever trailing twelve-month EBITDA of Rs 86,789 crore, led by its core infrastructure businesses.
* Adani group's tax contribution jumped to Rs 58,104 crore in the financial year 2023-24.

News tone:

* The tone is neutral, as the positive news of the group's strong EBITDA performance and increased tax contribution is offset by the negative news of the US SEC's fraud probe and the subsequent fall in stock prices.
* However, the overall tone is slightly positive, as the group's strong financial performance and increased tax contribution suggest a strong underlying business.

It's worth noting that the historical data suggests that the market reaction to Adani group news can be volatile, with both positive and negative impacts on the stock price.
