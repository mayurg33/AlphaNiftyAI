Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL for Reliance Industries.

Notable events:

1. Reliance Jio signs a deal with SpaceX, which could be a significant development for the company's future growth.
2. A Chandigarh man discovers old Reliance shares from 1988, worth lakhs, which is an interesting human-interest story but may not have a direct impact on the company's stock price.

Historical analysis suggests that the news tone is neutral, as the impact of similar news events in the past has been mixed. While some news events had a positive impact (e.g., +2.69% and +1.93%), others had a negative impact (e.g., -2.82%, -1.47%, and -1.26%). The current week's news does not seem to have a significant impact on the stock price, which is reflected in the flat share price.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, and investors may be waiting for more concrete developments or quarterly results to make a decisive move on the stock.
