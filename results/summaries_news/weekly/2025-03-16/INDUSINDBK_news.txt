The overall sentiment of the news articles this week is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY POSITIVE for IndusInd Bank.

**Notable Events:**

1. RBI's assurance that IndusInd Bank is well-capitalized and its financial position remains satisfactory, which helped to calm depositors' concerns.
2. The bank's share price crashed 26% to a 52-week low after reporting a net worth hit of â‚¹1,500 crore, but later rebounded sharply after the CEO expressed confidence in profit in Q4.
3. The RBI is examining banks' derivatives books, which may have contributed to the initial decline in the stock price.

While there were some negative news articles, such as the share price crash and concerns about the bank's derivatives exposure, the RBI's assurances and the CEO's confidence in Q4 profits helped to balance out the sentiment. Additionally, some articles highlighted the bank's stable financial health and potential for growth, which contributed to the neutral to slightly positive tone.

Overall, the news tone is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, but rather a mix of both, reflecting the volatility in the stock price this week.
