Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is mixed.

The first news article "Is this Tata Group IPO in Trouble? NCLT Approval Still Pending" suggests that there might be some uncertainty or delay in the IPO process, which could be perceived as negative news. However, historical data shows that news related to IPOs has had a positive impact on the stock price in the past.

The second news article "Tata Motors, along with its partner DIMO, announces the launch of its Allâ€“New Passenger Vehicle portfolio in Sri Lanka" is a positive development, as it indicates the company's expansion and growth plans. Historical data shows that news related to new launches and product expansions has had a mixed impact on the stock price, with some instances being positive and others being negative.

Notable events this week include the uncertainty surrounding the Tata Group IPO and the launch of a new passenger vehicle portfolio in Sri Lanka.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, as the positive news about the new launch is balanced by the uncertainty surrounding the IPO. However, given the historical data, the IPO-related news might have a positive impact on the stock price if the uncertainty is resolved favorably.
