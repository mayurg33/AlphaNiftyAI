**Weekly News Sentiment:** Neutral to Slightly Positive

**Notable Events:**

1. ITC announced its Q4 results, reporting a net profit of ₹19,807 crore, boosted by exceptional gains, and declared a final dividend of ₹7.85 per share.
2. British American Tobacco (BAT) trimmed its stake in ITC by 2.5% in a ₹12,941 crore deal to boost financial flexibility.
3. ITC's board recommended a final dividend of ₹7.85 per share.

**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to slightly positive, as the Q4 results and dividend announcement were well-received by the market. However, the sale of stake by BAT and the decline in ITC's shares by over 2% in a single session tempered the positive sentiment. The overall tone is neutral, as the market is digesting the news and awaiting further developments.

The historical data suggests that ITC's stock has reacted positively to dividend announcements and strong quarterly results in the past. However, the sale of stake by BAT and export curbs have had a negative impact on the stock in the past. Overall, the news tone is neutral, and the market is waiting for further cues to determine the direction of the stock.
