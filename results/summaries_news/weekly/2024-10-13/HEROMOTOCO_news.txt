Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE for Hero Motors.

The notable event is that Hero Motors has withdrawn its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) for its ₹900 crore Initial Public Offering (IPO). This news is neutral to slightly negative as it may indicate that the company is not ready to go public yet or may be facing some regulatory issues.

The historical similar news suggests that IPO-related news can have a mixed impact on the stock price. While some news items have a positive impact (e.g., RK Swamy files IPO papers with SEBI), others have a negative impact (e.g., CarTrade Tech gets SEBI nod for ₹2,000 crore IPO). The average impact of the historical similar news is around -0.5% to -1.5%, which suggests a slightly negative tone.

However, it's worth noting that the news tone may not be entirely negative, as the company may use this time to re-evaluate its IPO plans and come back stronger in the future. The impact of this news on the stock price will depend on various factors, including the company's financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.
