2. Ratan Tata's demise led to the cancellation of TCS's Q2 earnings press conference.
3. TCS plans to set up an IT facility in Andhra Pradesh, housing 10,000 employees.

**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to negative, primarily due to the mixed Q2 results and the cancellation of the earnings press conference following Ratan Tata's demise. The historical data suggests that TCS's stock price has been negatively impacted in similar situations, such as when the company's guidance was muted or when there were concerns about the IT sector.

However, there are some positive notes, such as the dividend announcement and the plans to set up a new IT facility in Andhra Pradesh. Overall, the news tone is cautious, and investors may be waiting for further guidance from the company before making a decision on the stock.
