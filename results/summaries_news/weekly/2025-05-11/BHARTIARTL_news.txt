Based on the historical data, the current week's news sentiment for Bharti Airtel is NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE.

Notable events:

* Bharti Airtel is set to declare its Q4 results, which has historically had a positive impact on the stock price.
* The company has also announced a dividend, which has previously led to a rise in share price.

The news tone is neutral to positive because the historical data suggests that Bharti Airtel's earnings announcements and dividend declarations have generally had a positive impact on the stock price. However, the second news article mentions a list of companies declaring earnings, including Bharti Airtel, and the historical data for similar news articles has had a mixed impact on the stock price. Overall, the tone is leaning towards positive due to the company-specific news about the dividend and earnings announcement.
