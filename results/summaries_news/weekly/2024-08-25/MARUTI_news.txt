The current week's news sentiment is negative, driven by concerns over slower sales, production adjustments, and weaker demand. Here's a summary of the notable events:

**Notable Events:**

1. Maruti Suzuki adjusts production to reduce dealer stock amid slower sales, indicating a demand slowdown.
2. The company may face a one-time hit in Q2 due to changes in tax laws, adding to the negative sentiment.
3. Car demand in India is weaker than expected, according to Suzuki Motor Corp, which may impact Maruti Suzuki's sales.

**News Tone:** Negative

The news tone is predominantly negative, with three out of four news articles conveying a negative sentiment. The production adjustment and weaker demand are likely to weigh on the stock, while the one-time hit in Q2 due to tax law changes adds to the negative sentiment.
