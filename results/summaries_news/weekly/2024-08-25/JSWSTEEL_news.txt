Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL to NEGATIVE for the steel and cement giants' stocks.

The notable event is the Supreme Court's nod for the government to collect retro taxes from steel and cement companies, which is likely to have a negative impact on their financials.

Historical similar news suggests that such events can lead to a decline in stock prices. For example, Shree Cement's stock price fell by 2.38% when it received an inspection order from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Similarly, when the government slapped duties on petrol, diesel, and crude, shares of ONGC, Chennai Petro, and RIL skidded up to 13%.

However, it's worth noting that the impact of such news can be unpredictable, and the stock price may not always react negatively. For instance, Shree Cement's stock price rose by 1.82% when it was reported to be losing its key edge over peers.

Overall, the news tone is cautionary, and investors should be prepared for potential volatility in the steel and cement giants' stocks.
