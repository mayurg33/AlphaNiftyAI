Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL.

The news preview suggests that Grasim Industries is expected to report a 30% topline growth in its Q3 results, which is a positive indicator. However, the margins are expected to fall due to losses in new businesses, which is a negative aspect.

Notable events from the historical similar news include:

* A positive impact of +4.73% when the company reported a jump in consolidated net profit in December 2020.
* A negative impact of -3.22% when the company received an income tax demand of Rs 8,334 crore in October 2021.
* A positive impact of +2.99% when the company entered the paints business in January 2021.

Overall, the news tone is neutral as the positive aspect of topline growth is offset by the negative aspect of margin decline.
