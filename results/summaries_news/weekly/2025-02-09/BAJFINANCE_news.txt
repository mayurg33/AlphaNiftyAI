Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is overall positive for Bajaj Finance.

Notable events:

* Bajaj Finance shares rose 5% to hit a record high post-Budget 2025, indicating a strong market reaction to the budget announcements.
* The company is in talks with Allianz to exit their joint venture, which could have significant implications for the company's future strategy.

The news tone is positive for the stock, driven by the record high share price and the potential exit from the joint venture with Allianz. The historical data suggests that similar news events have had a positive impact on the stock price, with an average impact of around 5-10%.

The only neutral/negative news event is the historical data point about Bajaj Finserv getting Sebi approval for mutual fund business, which had a negative impact of -1.85%. However, this event is not directly related to Bajaj Finance's current news and is therefore not a significant concern.

Overall, the current week's news sentiment is positive, and investors may expect the stock to continue its upward trend in the short term.
