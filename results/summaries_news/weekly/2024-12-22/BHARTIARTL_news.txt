**News Sentiment:**

The overall news sentiment for the week is **Neutral**.

This has resulted in a loss of investor wealth, which is a negative sentiment.

ICICI Bank's inclusion in the top trading ideas is also a positive sentiment, but its impact is uncertain without more specific information.

Overall, the news tone is neutral, with both positive and negative sentiments present. However, the market's current downturn is likely to have a more significant impact on investor sentiment.
