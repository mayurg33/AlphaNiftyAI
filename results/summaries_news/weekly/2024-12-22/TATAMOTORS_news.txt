The current week's news sentiment for Tata Motors Ltd is overall negative. The notable events are:

* The stock has dropped for five straight sessions, which is a bearish signal.
* The stock is down 38% from its July high, which may indicate a value buy opportunity, but the overall tone is still negative.
* The 1:2 stock split announcement has not had a positive impact on the stock price, with the stock being Rs 28 away from its 52-week low and having 0% returns YTD.

The news tone is negative for the stock, with two out of three news headlines having a negative tone. The historical similar news and price impact data also suggest a negative impact on the stock price, with most of the similar news events resulting in a decline in the stock price.

However, it's worth noting that LKP has recommended a BUY rating for the stock with a target price of Rs 970, which could be a contrarian view. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment for the week is bearish, and investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions.
