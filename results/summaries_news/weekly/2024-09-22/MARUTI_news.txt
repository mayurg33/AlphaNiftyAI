The notable events are the partnership between Tata Capital and Maruti Suzuki for financing solutions, which is a positive development for both companies. However, the historical data suggests that similar news in the past has had a mixed impact on the stock prices.

The negative impact is mainly driven by the news related to Tata Motors' finance arms selling loan assets, which had a significant negative impact of -12.68%.
