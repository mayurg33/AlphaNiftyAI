* The bank's NII (Net Interest Income) has risen by 14.75%, and PAT (Profit After Tax) has jumped over 10% YoY despite a dip in total income.

**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to positive, as the bank's Q3 results have shown significant growth in net profit and NII. The increase in PAT despite a dip in total income is also a positive sign.
