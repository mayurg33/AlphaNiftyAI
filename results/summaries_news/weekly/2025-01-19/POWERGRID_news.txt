Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is overall positive for Power Grid Corporation.

Notable events:

* Power Finance Corp has transferred 2 subsidiaries to Power Grid and GR Infraprojects, which could be a positive development for Power Grid.
* The Power Grid Corporation share price has jumped 2.8%, with a short-term target of Rs 306, indicating a bullish outlook.

Historical analysis suggests that similar news events have had a positive impact on the stock price in the past. For example, when Power Grid Corp jumped due to the board's decision to consider an interim dividend, the stock price increased by 2.17%. Similarly, when REC's subsidiary handed over an SPV to Power Grid Corporation, the stock price rose by 2.26%.

The only negative impact was seen when REC suggested transferring PFC's ownership of a company to PGCIL, which led to a decline of 4.86% in the stock price. However, this event is not directly comparable to the current news.

Overall, the news tone is positive for Power Grid Corporation, with a potential upside in the short term.
