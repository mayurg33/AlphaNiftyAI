**Summary of Current Week's News Sentiment:**

The overall sentiment of the news this week is **Neutral** for ITC stock. The news is dominated by the announcement of ITC's Q4 results, which showed a significant jump in profit due to exceptional gains, and the declaration of a final dividend of ₹7.85 per share. While the profit growth is positive, the flattish revenue growth and the sale of stake by British American Tobacco (BAT) might have tempered the enthusiasm.

2. British American Tobacco (BAT) trimmed its stake in ITC by 2.5% in a ₹12,941 crore deal to boost financial flexibility.
3. ITC's board recommended a final dividend of ₹7.85 per share.
