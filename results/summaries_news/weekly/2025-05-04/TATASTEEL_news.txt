* The company has unveiled a Rs 27,000-crore expansion plan for its Kalinganagar facility, which is expected to boost capacity.
* The stock has seen a modest fall amid high trading volume in one of the sessions.

The news tone is neutral because:

* The first news item raises concerns about the inconsistency in financials, which could be a negative factor.
* The second news item reports a modest fall in the stock price, which is also a negative factor.
* However, the third news item is positive, as it reports a significant expansion plan that could boost capacity and potentially benefit the company in the long run.
