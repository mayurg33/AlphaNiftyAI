Notable events:

* Jio Financial Services' stock gained 0.16% during today's trading session, which is a mildly positive development.
* Shriram Finance raised $300 million via an innovative ABS transaction, which is a significant fundraising event.

Historical context:

* Jio Financial Services has seen positive price impacts in the past, with gains of +2.43% and +2.54% following news of LIC acquiring a stake and Reliance's financial unit being valued at over $20 billion, respectively.
* Shriram Finance, on the other hand, has seen mixed price impacts in the past, with a negative impact of -0.17% following the appointment of a new chief digital officer, and no clear pattern emerging from the other two historical events.

However, the historical context suggests that the impact of these events on the stock price may be limited, and investors should exercise caution when making investment decisions.
