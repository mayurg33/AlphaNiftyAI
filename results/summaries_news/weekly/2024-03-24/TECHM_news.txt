Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL.

The news tone is neutral because the three news articles all report on the same event, which is Tech Mahindra's merger of two US-based subsidiaries. This event is a neutral to slightly positive development for the company, as it is a strategic move to consolidate and streamline its operations.

Notable events mentioned in the historical similar news include:

* Tech Mahindra's acquisition of stakes in various companies, such as Perigord, Activus Connect, and Eventus Solutions Group, which had mixed impacts on the stock price.
* Tech Mahindra's partnerships and agreements, such as the managed security services pact with Palo Alto Networks, which had a negative impact on the stock price.
* Tech Mahindra's acquisitions of European firms, which had a significant negative impact on the stock price.

Overall, the current week's news tone is neutral, and the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, as the merger is a strategic move that is not expected to have a significant immediate impact on the company's financials.
