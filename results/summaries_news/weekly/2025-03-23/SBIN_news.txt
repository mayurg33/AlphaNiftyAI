Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is NEUTRAL to NEGATIVE for State Bank of India (SBI).

The news reports that SBI has shelved its $1.7 billion fund-raising plan due to elevated yields, which may be perceived as a negative development for the bank. This decision may indicate that the bank is facing challenges in raising capital at favorable rates, which could impact its growth plans.

Notable events in the past include SBI's consideration of long-term fund-raising up to $2 billion in 2021, which had a positive impact on the stock (+4.20%). Additionally, the bank's successful bond issuance of $750 million in 2023 had a significant positive impact (+6.34%).

In contrast, the current news has a neutral to negative tone, which may lead to a short-term decline in the stock price. However, it is essential to consider the broader market conditions and the bank's overall performance to determine the long-term implications of this news.
