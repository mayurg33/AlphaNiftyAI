Based on the historical similar news and price impact, the current week's news sentiment for Axis Bank is NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

The two news articles, "Axis Bank, Piramal Capital in co-lending tie-up" and "Axis Bank Joins hand with Piramal Finance Under Co-Lending Business", suggest that Axis Bank is expanding its co-lending business by partnering with Piramal Finance. However, the historical similar news and price impact suggest that such partnerships or tie-ups may not have a significant positive impact on the stock price.

In fact, the historical data suggests that similar news events have resulted in a negative price impact, ranging from -1.05% to -3.31%. This could be due to various factors such as market expectations, competition, and regulatory approvals.

Notable events mentioned in the historical data include Paytm and Citi ending their tie-up for a co-branded credit card, IRDAI approval for Axis Entities-Max Life Insurance deal, and Max Financial receiving approval to divest up to 12% stake in Max Life.

Overall, the news tone is neutral to slightly negative, indicating that the market may not be overly enthusiastic about Axis Bank's co-lending partnership with Piramal Finance.
