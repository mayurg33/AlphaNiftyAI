**Historical Context:**

Historically, similar news events have had a mixed impact on the stock price. While some news of capacity expansion and investment have led to a positive impact (+3.16%), others have resulted in a negative impact (-2.81%, -0.66%, and -3.29%). This suggests that the market's reaction to such news is not always consistent and may depend on various factors such as the company's financial performance, industry trends, and overall market sentiment.

**Tone of the News:**
