**News Tone:**

The overall news tone for Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv is neutral to positive. The Q1 results announcements have been received positively, with net profit increases of 10% and 14% for Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance, respectively. This suggests that the companies are performing well financially.

However, there is a cautionary note from the "Stock Alert" article, which suggests that Bajaj Finance may underperform markets in the near-term. This could be a concern for investors.

Historical data suggests that positive earnings announcements have generally led to positive price impacts, with some exceptions. The news tone is therefore more positive than negative, but investors should be cautious due to the potential underperformance warning.

Overall, the news sentiment is neutral to positive, with a slight bias towards positivity due to the strong Q1 results.
