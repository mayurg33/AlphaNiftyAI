**Notable Events:**

1. Coal India fixes August 16 as the record date for final dividend, which historically has a negative impact on the stock price.
2. Several companies, including SBI, Tata Steel, Coal India, BHEL, Pfizer, and Sun Pharma, are set to declare their Q1 results next week, which can lead to market volatility.

**News Tone:**

The news tone is neutral to negative for the stock. The historical data suggests that the declaration of dividend and trading ex-dividend can lead to a decline in Coal India's stock price.
