**Current Week's News Sentiment:** Negative

**Notable Events:** Sun Pharma's shares have slipped 3-5% due to a US court's ruling that bars the company from launching its alopecia drug, LEQSELVITM.

**News Tone:** The news tone is overwhelmingly negative, with all four news articles reporting a decline in Sun Pharma's share price. The negative sentiment is driven by the US court's ruling, which has halted the launch of the company's alopecia treatment drug. This event has led to a significant decline in the company's share price, with all four articles reporting a 3-5% drop.

In contrast, the historical news articles show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, with some articles reporting gains in Sun Pharma's share price due to positive developments such as FDA approvals and acquisitions. However, the current week's news is dominated by the negative impact of the US court's ruling.
