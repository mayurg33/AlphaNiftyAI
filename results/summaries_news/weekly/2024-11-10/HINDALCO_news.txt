Based on the current week's news, the sentiment is predominantly negative for Hindalco Industries.

Notable events:

* Hindalco Industries shares fell 7% and 9% respectively due to Novelis reporting an 18% decline in Q2 net profit.
* The company was mentioned in the "Stocks in news" category, which may have contributed to the negative sentiment.

Historical analysis suggests that when Hindalco's net profit declines, the stock price tends to fall (e.g., -4.19% and -4.40% impacts). On the other hand, positive news such as Novelis' plan to build an aluminum recycling plant in the US led to a 1.88% increase in the stock price.

Given the current news, the tone is negative for Hindalco Industries, with a potential downward pressure on the stock price.
