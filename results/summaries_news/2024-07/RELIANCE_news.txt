Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Despite Reliance Industries' Q1 results showing a 5% year-over-year drop in net profit and flat ARPU, the company's revenue has risen 11-12% and Jio has achieved record PAT. The mixed results warrant a HOLD decision, as the company's long-term investment plans, including a $60 billion investment over the next 10 years, suggest potential for future growth.
