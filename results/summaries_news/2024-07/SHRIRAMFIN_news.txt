Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent Q1 results of Shriram Finance show a 19% YoY jump in consolidated profit, meeting estimates, which is a positive sign. However, the news sentiment is mostly neutral, with no major surprises or concerns reported, hence a HOLD decision is recommended to wait for more developments.
