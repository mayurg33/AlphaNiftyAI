After analyzing the recent headlines, I conclude that the overall news sentiment for Britannia Industries is POSITIVE.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The news suggests that Britannia Industries is taking steps to support volumes and topline growth through price cuts and higher grammage, and has recently appointed Urjit Patel as an independent director, which is seen as a positive development. Additionally, analysts are bullish on the stock, predicting a potential 7-20% rise in the next 3-4 weeks.
