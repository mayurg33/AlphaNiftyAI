Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite receiving an additional tax demand, Cipla's Q1FY25 results showed a focus on branded and emerging market expansions, and the company has reported a record high revenue in North America, leading to a positive sentiment and expectation of 13% upside from HSBC, making it a good buying opportunity.
