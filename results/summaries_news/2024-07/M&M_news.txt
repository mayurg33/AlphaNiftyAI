Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent decline in M&M's share price appears to be a short-term correction, driven by market sentiment rather than any fundamental concerns. Meanwhile, the company's Q1 results have been positive, with a 23% jump in net profit, and the clarification issued by the company has helped to alleviate some of the concerns, making it a hold for now.
