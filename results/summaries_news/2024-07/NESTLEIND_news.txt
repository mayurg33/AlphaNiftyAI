After analyzing the recent headlines about NESTLEIND, I conclude that:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the company's Q1 results missed street estimates, the net profit still showed a 7% year-over-year growth, and the revenue growth, although slow, was still positive; investors may want to wait for further clarity on the company's future growth prospects and potential impact of commodity inflation before making a buy or sell decision.
