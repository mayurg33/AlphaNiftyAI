After analyzing the recent headlines, I conclude that:

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite a mixed Q1 result, the company's strong outlook, massive capex plans, and dividend announcement have driven the stock to hit new highs, indicating a positive market sentiment and potential for further growth.

Here's a breakdown of the sentiments:

* Positive news: Strong outlook, capex plans, dividend announcement, and a multibagger stock receiving an order from Power Grid Corp. have contributed to the positive sentiment.
* Neutral news: PSU appointments, stocks to watch lists, and record date announcements are neutral and don't impact the overall sentiment.
* Negative news: The Q1 result, which saw a 4% dip in profit, is a concern, but it seems to be overshadowed by the positive news and outlook.

Overall, the positive news and outlook seem to dominate the sentiment, making it a BUY recommendation.
