After analyzing the recent headlines about TITAN, I would summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE, with most articles focusing on the company's disappointing Q1 performance and subsequent target price cuts.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the company's Q1 results were disappointing, some analysts still believe the stock has upside potential in the short term, and the overall sentiment is not overwhelmingly bearish. It's a good time to reassess and wait for further developments before making a buy or sell decision.
