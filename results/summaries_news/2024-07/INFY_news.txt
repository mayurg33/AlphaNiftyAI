Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with Infosys reporting strong Q1 results, raising its revenue growth guidance, and expecting to hire 15,000-20,000 freshers, indicating a robust outlook. Despite the GST demand notice, the company's financials and growth prospects seem strong, making it a good buy.
