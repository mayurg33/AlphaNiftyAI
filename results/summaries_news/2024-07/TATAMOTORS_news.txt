Reason: Tata Motors' strong Q1 FY25 results, with a 74% surge in net profit, beat estimates and triggered a rating upgrade from Nomura, accompanied by a record-high price target of Rs 1,294. The demerger scheme and new corporate structure are also seen as positive developments, driving the stock to an all-time high.
