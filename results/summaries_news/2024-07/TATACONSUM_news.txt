Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent news headlines about Tata Consumer Products (TATACONSUM) are mixed, with both positive and negative sentiments. While the company's rights issue and plans to boost growth in its core businesses are positives, the drop in net profit and potential dilution of earnings due to the rights issue are negatives, making it a HOLD for now.
