Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent Q1 results of Asian Paints have been disappointing, with a 24-25% drop in net profit and a 2.3% decline in revenue, missing estimates. However, the company has announced a price hike across its portfolio, which could help mitigate the impact of unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures, and therefore, it's a HOLD for now, awaiting further clarity on the company's future performance.
