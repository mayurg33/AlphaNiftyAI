After analyzing the recent headlines about Axis Bank, I have summarized the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL TO CAUTIOUS.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the Q1FY25 results were a negative surprise, leading to a sharp decline in the stock price, some brokerages like JM Financial still see an upside target price of Rs 1375. However, concerns around loan quality and rising credit costs persist, making it a HOLD decision for now, until further clarity emerges.
