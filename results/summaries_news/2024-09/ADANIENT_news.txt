After analyzing the recent headlines about ADANIENT, I conclude that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL with a slightly POSITIVE bias.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the group faces some challenges from Hindenburg's allegations and Swiss probes, the positive news around its stake sale, successful bond issuances, and investments in growth areas like data centers outweigh the negatives, making it a HOLD for now.
