After analyzing the recent headlines, I observe that:

* Apollo Hospitals has sold a 16.9% stake in its subsidiary Apollo Healthco to Rasmeli for â‚¹2,475 crore, which can be seen as a positive development for the company.
* The stock has broken out to multi-year highs, indicating a strong upward momentum.
* There is no negative news or concerns specific to Apollo Hospitals in the recent headlines.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The recent stake sale and break out to multi-year highs suggest a positive sentiment around the stock, making it an attractive buy opportunity.
