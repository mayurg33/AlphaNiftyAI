After analyzing the recent headlines about ASIANPAINT, I summarize the overall news sentiment as POSITIVE.

Here's a breakdown of the news:

**Positive news:**

* Asian Paints has fixed a record date for dividend payment, indicating a cash reward for investors (ET Now, Mint).
* The company has reported good 4Q and full FY 2024 results (Coatings World).

* Technical analysis suggests a breakout above resistance level, indicating a potential upward trend (The Economic Times).

**Negative news:**
