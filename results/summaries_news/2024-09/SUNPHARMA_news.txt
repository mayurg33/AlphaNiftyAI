Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Sun Pharma has made some positive moves, such as entering into an exclusive agreement with Philogen for commercialising anti-cancer immunotherapy, the company is also facing scrutiny from CDSCO for quality failures in 53 drugs, and the overall pharma sector is experiencing pressure, making it a neutral hold for now.
