Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The stock has been surging to record highs, with a 3.66% increase in a single day, and has been preferred by HSBC over TVS Motor Company, indicating strong investor confidence. Additionally, the company has declared a dividend of Rs 65 per share, which is a positive development for investors.
