Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the recent rally has led to a record high and a 95% gain in the past year, the contradicting views from UBS, which projects a 45% downside, suggest that the stock may be due for a correction, and a hold decision allows for a more cautious approach before making a buying or selling decision.
