After analyzing the recent headlines about WIPRO, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL.

The negative headlines, such as "Wipro Ltd down for fifth straight session" and "Wipro, HCL Tech shed 3...", suggest a short-term decline in the stock's performance. However, the positive news, including Wipro Ventures' successful fundraise of $200 million and the company's plans to invest in startups, indicate a strong long-term strategy.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The stock's short-term fluctuations are overshadowed by Wipro's promising long-term initiatives, making it a hold for now.
