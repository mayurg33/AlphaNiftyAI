Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The news sentiment surrounding UltraTech Cement's entry into the wires and cables segment is mixed, with some brokerages recommending a "buy on correction" and others expressing caution, leading to a neutral stance. While the company's Rs 1.8K crore capex investment and potential 4-5x revenue growth may be positive long-term catalysts, the short-term uncertainty and 5-6% stock slide warrant a hold decision.
