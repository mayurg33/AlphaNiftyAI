Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Despite posting strong Q3 results with a 49-52% YoY profit growth, the stock has been declining due to profit-booking and concerns over Adani Group's foray into the healthcare sector, making the current sentiment neutral, and investors should hold their positions until further clarity emerges.
