After analyzing the recent headlines about COALINDIA, I would suggest:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are some positive developments, such as the additional levy announcement and the joint venture with EDF for renewables, the stock has also hit 52-week lows and there are concerns about meeting FY25 production guidance, making it a neutral hold for now.
