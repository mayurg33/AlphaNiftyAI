After analyzing the recent headlines about TCS, I notice a mix of positive and negative news. On the positive side, the company has partnered with UPM to modernize its IT landscape, is rolling out salary hikes, and has formed a partnership with Salesforce. On the negative side, the stock has been experiencing a downturn, with a significant decline in market capitalization, and variable pay for senior executives has been cut.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are some positive developments, the recent stock price decline and market capitalization erosion are significant concerns, making it prudent to hold the stock for now and monitor the situation closely.
