Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Although the news sentiment is mixed, with some positive developments like the collaboration with Henlius for commercialization of HLX15 and the company's confidence in staying competitive despite US tariff plans, there are also concerns around the USFDA asking the company to sort out issues at its Hyderabad facility and the â‚¹184 crore penalty over unpaid GST. Therefore, a cautious approach is recommended, and investors should hold onto their positions until more clarity emerges on these issues.
