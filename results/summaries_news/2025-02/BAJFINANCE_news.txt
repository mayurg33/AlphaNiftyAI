After analyzing the recent headlines about BAJFINANCE, I observe an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The stock has been hitting record highs, and analysts are bullish about its prospects. The RBI's easing of risk weight norms has also provided a boost to the stock.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The stock's upward momentum, driven by positive Budget announcements and regulatory tailwinds, suggests further growth potential, making it a compelling buy opportunity.
