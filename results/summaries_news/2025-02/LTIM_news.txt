After analyzing the recent headlines about LTIMindtree Ltd, I conclude that:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are some positive developments, such as partnerships with Eurobank and being listed as one of the IT stocks to buy, the company's recent stock performance has been slipping for five straight sessions, and internal changes, such as the new appraisal policy, may create near-term uncertainty, warranting a cautious hold stance.
