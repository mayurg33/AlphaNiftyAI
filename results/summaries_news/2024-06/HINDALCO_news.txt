After analyzing the recent headlines about Hindalco, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL. While the deferment of Novelis' IPO in the US due to market conditions has had a negative impact on Hindalco's share price, the company's interests in Hindustan Copper's Jharkhand mines and the outperformance of metal stocks in the market have provided some positive sentiments.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The temporary setback due to the IPO deferment is offset by the company's potential opportunities in Hindustan Copper's mines and the positive momentum in metal stocks, making it a hold for now.
