Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The recent headlines suggest a positive sentiment around Eicher Motors, with the company reporting a 10% YoY increase in CV sales in May and strong domestic and international growth, indicating a strong fundamental performance. This, combined with the overall bullish market trend and sectoral indices edging higher, makes it an attractive buy opportunity.
