Reason: While TCS has received a significant fine in the US court, the company has also announced several positive developments, including a deal with Xerox to transform its IT technology, expansion of its partnership with Xerox, and the launch of a new GenAI aggregation platform. The mixed news sentiment suggests holding the stock for now, as the company's growth prospects and innovation efforts may outweigh the negative impact of the fine.
