Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Bajaj Auto's domestic business momentum is expected to sustain and its export volumes are likely to recover, the company's total sales in May remained flat YoY, indicating some challenges in the short term. Overall, the news sentiment is neutral, with both positive and negative developments, warranting a hold decision until further clarity emerges.
