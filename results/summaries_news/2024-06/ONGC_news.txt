After analyzing the recent headlines about ONGC, I summarize the overall news sentiment as BULLISH.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The positive news flow, including a target price upgrade by Geojit Financial Services, a massive capex plan, and partnerships with foreign companies and other PSUs for new projects, outweigh the negative news of government slashing domestic natural gas prices, indicating a strong growth potential for ONGC.
