Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent headlines suggest a mix of positive and negative news, with Wipro announcing two significant deals worth $550 million and $500 million, and developing 2,000 AI use cases, which are positives. However, the company's female workforce saw a significant decline, and the CEO termed FY24 as one of the most challenging years in the company's history, which are negatives. Overall, the sentiment is neutral, and it's best to hold the stock until further clarity emerges.
