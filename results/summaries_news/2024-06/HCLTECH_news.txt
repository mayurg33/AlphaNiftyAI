Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the recent block deal and sale of shares by Fidelity Investments may raise some concerns, the positive news around the $278-million deal with apoBank, Morgan Stanley's optimistic view, and the company's reported progress in its software products business outweigh the negative sentiment, making it a HOLD for now.
