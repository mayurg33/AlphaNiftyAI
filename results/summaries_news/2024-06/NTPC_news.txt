After analyzing the recent headlines about NTPC, I would suggest:

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The overall sentiment is positive, with the company announcing ambitious plans to double coal production and investing $50 billion to transform into a complete energy company, which indicates strong growth potential. Additionally, Morgan Stanley has recommended NTPC as a key beneficiary of India's capex boom, further supporting the buy decision.
