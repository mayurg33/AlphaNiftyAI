Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Despite a 3% drop in net profit, the company has declared a significant final dividend of Rs 73 per share, and the stock has surged to near record levels, indicating positive market sentiment. However, the mixed earnings report and slight decline in profit warrants a cautious approach, making a HOLD a more suitable decision at this time.
