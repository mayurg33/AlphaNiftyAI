Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the recent headlines highlight muted sales volumes and prices for Ultratech Cement and other cement companies, they also suggest a positive outlook for the current fiscal year. Additionally, the industry is expected to benefit from rising demand, and the company's financials and future plans remain strong, warranting a hold decision.
