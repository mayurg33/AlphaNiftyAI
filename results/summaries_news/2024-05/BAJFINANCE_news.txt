Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with multiple reports highlighting the RBI's lifting of restrictions on Bajaj Finance's eCOM and Insta EMI Card, which is expected to boost the company's lending business. Additionally, the company's partnership with Tata Motors and its record debt raising exercise further support the positive outlook.
