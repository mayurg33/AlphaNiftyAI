After analyzing the recent headlines about Maruti Suzuki India, I conclude that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the company's April sales figures disappointed the Street, leading to a 2% stock fall, the overall sentiment is lifted by positive news on expansion plans, price cuts, and growth targets, including aims to sell 2 million vehicles this fiscal year and setting up new service outlets.
