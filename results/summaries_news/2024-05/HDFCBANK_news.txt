Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are concerns about the bank's growth prospects and mixed sentiment from FIIs and mutual funds, the company's recent developments, such as the extended credit line from IFC, reappointment of a part-time chairman, and EPS upgrades, suggest a stable and positive outlook, making it a hold for now.
