Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While ITC's Q4 results missed estimates with a marginal fall in profit, the company has declared a dividend of ₹7.5 per share, which is a positive sign. Additionally, 31 analysts have given a "buy" rating with a target price of ₹470, indicating potential upside in the short term. However, the demerger plan has received mixed reviews from proxy advisory firms, and the stock's short-term performance will depend on the success of this plan. Therefore, a "hold" decision is recommended until there is more clarity on the demerger's impact on the company's future prospects.
