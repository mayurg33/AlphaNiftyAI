Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The recent headlines suggest a strong quarterly performance by Hindalco, with a 70% YoY jump in profit and improved margins, beating estimates. The company's plans for a large capex and its subsidiary's IPO plans are also positive developments, which are reflected in the stock's record high price, making it a buy.
