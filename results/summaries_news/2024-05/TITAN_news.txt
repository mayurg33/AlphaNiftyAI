Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Titan's Q4 results missed estimates, causing a 7% decline in share price, the company's net profit still rose 7% YoY and declared a dividend of â‚¹11 per share. Additionally, brokerages have cut target prices, but the company remains "comfortable" with its debt levels and financial stance, suggesting a balanced position.
