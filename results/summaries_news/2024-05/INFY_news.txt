After analyzing the recent headlines about INFY, I conclude:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The news sentiment is neutral to mildly positive, with some positive developments such as partnerships and dividend declarations, but also some neutral to negative news like share price fall and stake sale by a family member, suggesting a wait-and-watch approach.
