Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While Wipro is partnering with Microsoft on innovative AI projects, which is a positive development, the news of Adani Enterprises set to replace Wipro in the Sensex is a negative sentiment. Overall, the stock is experiencing mixed signals, and a HOLD decision is recommended to monitor further developments.
