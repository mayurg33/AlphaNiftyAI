Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While L&T's Q4 results beat estimates with a 10.2% jump in net profit, the company's weak guidance has prompted target price cuts from brokerages, resulting in a mixed sentiment. Therefore, it's advisable to hold the stock until there is more clarity on the company's future prospects.
