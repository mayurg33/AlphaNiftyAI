Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite recent weakness in FMCG stocks, Hindustan Unilever's (HUL) strong brand portfolio, including Vim's nearing Rs 3,000 crore mark, and the company's focus on innovation and premiumization suggest a positive outlook, supported by multiple "BUY" recommendations from various brokerages.
