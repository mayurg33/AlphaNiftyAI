Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The majority of the news headlines are positive, indicating a significant transformation in the company's business with the exit from the housing finance segment and the injection of fresh capital from Warburg Pincus. Additionally, the company is exploring new growth opportunities in green finance, and the stock split is likely to make the stock more attractive to investors, supporting the "Buy" call from Axis Securities.
