Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While the stock has received positive news with the resolution of the Bhushan Steel case and plans to launch its own EV brand, it is also facing challenges from the GST Authority and an investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) on steel imports. As a result, the overall sentiment is neutral, and it is best to hold the stock until further clarity emerges on these issues.
