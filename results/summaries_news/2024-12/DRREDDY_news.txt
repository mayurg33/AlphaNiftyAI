Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The overall news sentiment for DRREDDY seems to be neutral to slightly positive, with the company posting solid gains and having a robust quarterly earnings announcement schedule. However, the penalty imposed by the Kazakhstan authority on one of its units is a slight negative, which prevents me from giving a BUY recommendation.
