Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall sentiment is positive, with Wipro reporting a 10% revenue growth and 35% profit jump in FY24, and its shares rising on a $40 million deal to buy a US firm. Additionally, the company is about to trade ex-bonus, which may lead to a short-term correction, but the underlying fundamentals and long-term growth potential make it an attractive buy.
