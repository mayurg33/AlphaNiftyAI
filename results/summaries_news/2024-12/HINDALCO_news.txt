After analyzing the recent headlines about Hindalco, I observed that:

* There are several mentions of Hindalco as a stock to watch, indicating investor interest and potential trading opportunities.
* The company has received a coal mine allocation order in Odisha, which could be a positive development for its business.
* Axis Direct has recommended buying Hindalco stock with a specific target and stop loss, further supporting the bullish sentiment.
* However, the company has faced a penalty from GST authorities, which could be a minor negative factor.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The overall sentiment is positive, with multiple analyst recommendations and a favorable development in the coal mine allocation, outweighing the minor penalty issue.
