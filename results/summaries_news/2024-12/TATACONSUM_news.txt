Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The overall news sentiment is neutral, with a mix of positive and negative news. While the stock has shown impressive growth in the past, recent reports of weak commentary and sliding stock prices are causes for concern, but the company's clarification on Starbucks not exiting India has alleviated some fears, making it a hold for now.
