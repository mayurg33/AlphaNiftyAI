After analyzing the recent headlines about ITC, I can summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE.

The demerger of ITC's hotels business is a significant development, and analysts are upbeat about the outlook for ITC shares. The record date and effective date for the demerger have been announced, providing clarity for investors. While there is some negativity around the proposed GST hike on cigarettes and other tobacco products, the overall sentiment remains positive.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The demerger of ITC's hotels business is a positive development, but the proposed GST hike on cigarettes and other tobacco products introduces some uncertainty, making it prudent to hold the stock for now.
