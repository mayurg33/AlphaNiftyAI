Based on the recent headlines, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

Reason: While Titan's revenue has increased by 9% YoY, its net profit has dropped marginally, missing estimates, and high gold prices have impacted the results. However, the company's trading volume has seen a remarkable surge, and its â‚¹1 lakh crore dream still holds potential, making it a hold for now.
