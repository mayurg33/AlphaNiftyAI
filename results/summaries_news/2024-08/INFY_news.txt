Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent headlines about Infosys (INFY) are mixed, with both positive and negative news. On the one hand, the company has received a large GST demand notice, which could impact its financials, and is involved in a lawsuit with Cognizant over trade secrets. On the other hand, the government is open to resolving the tax dispute, and the company has made progress in onboarding delays. Additionally, the stock has performed well so far in 2024, up 20%. Given the uncertainty and conflicting news, it's best to hold the stock for now and wait for more clarity on these issues.
