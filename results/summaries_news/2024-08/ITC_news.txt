After analyzing the recent headlines about ITC, I concluded that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL with a slightly POSITIVE bias.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite missing estimates, ITC's Q1 results showed revenue growth of 7.5% and a marginal increase in net profit, which is a positive sign. Additionally, several brokerages and analysts have recommended buying the stock, citing its low PE ratio and potential for growth.
