After analyzing the recent headlines about INDUSINDBK, I observe a mix of positive and negative news:

Positive news:

* RBI nod for setting up a mutual fund asset management business, which is a significant expansion opportunity for the bank.
* The mutual fund business is expected to provide a new revenue stream and diversify the bank's income.

Negative news:

* The stock has been falling consistently, hitting a 52-week low, due to global concerns and growth worries.
* The decline is also attributed to the bank's existing valuation being rich, and investors are cautious about the bank's ability to deliver strong growth.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the RBI approval for the mutual fund business is a positive development, the stock's recent decline and concerns about growth and valuation warrant a cautious approach. It is essential to wait and see how the bank executes its new business and addresses the growth concerns before making a definitive call.
