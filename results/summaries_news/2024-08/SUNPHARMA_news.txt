Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with the company reporting a 40% increase in profit in Q1, driven by robust global specialty sales, and announcing investments in US-based Pharmazz, indicating a strong growth strategy. Additionally, the company's R&D spending is expected to increase in coming quarters, which should drive future growth.
