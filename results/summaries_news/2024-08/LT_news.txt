Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with L&T Finance achieving NBFC-ICC status, bagging a large order for its Transportation Infrastructure vertical, and partnering with CRED to offer personal loans, indicating business growth and expansion. Additionally, the Bombay HC's quashing of the Rs 2,237-cr GST demand against L&T has removed a significant overhang on the stock.
