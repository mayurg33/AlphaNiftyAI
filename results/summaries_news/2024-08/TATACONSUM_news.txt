Based on the recent headlines, I would suggest:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: The news sentiment is neutral, with a mix of positive (rights issue, merger completion, and CEO's confidence in profitability) and negative (FMCG distributors' concerns and need for exponential growth) headlines, indicating a stable but not necessarily exciting period for the stock.
