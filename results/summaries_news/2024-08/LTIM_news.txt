Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with the stock price target being upgraded by Kotak, a GST relief, and a significant jump in shares (up to 8%) despite being excluded from the Nifty 50 index. This suggests that the company's fundamentals are strong and investors are confident in its growth prospects.
