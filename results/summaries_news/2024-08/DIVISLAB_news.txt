After analyzing the recent headlines, I found that the overall news sentiment for DIVISLAB is POSITIVE.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: Despite being excluded from the Nifty 50 index, the stock has seen a jump in share price due to positive developments such as a US court stay on FDA approval for Entresto drug and bullish bets in the F&O market, indicating a strong market sentiment.
