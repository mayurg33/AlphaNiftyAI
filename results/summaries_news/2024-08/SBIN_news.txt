Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While SBI is making efforts to expand into wealth management and aims to divest its stake in Yes Bank, the recent Q1 results have been underwhelming, leading to a decline in the stock price. However, analysts believe the correction is temporary and expect a rebound in the next 3-4 weeks, making it a hold for now.
