After analyzing the recent headlines about WIPRO, I found that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL to POSITIVE.

The positive news includes Wipro's appointment of a new global head for its engineering edge business line, expansion of its partnership with Dell Tech to integrate AI enterprise solutions, and its stock price trending upwards. Additionally, Wipro is featured in various "stocks to watch" lists, indicating that analysts and investors are keeping a close eye on the company.

However, there is also some neutral to negative news, such as the resignation of Wipro's chief technology officer and no major breakthrough announcements or exceptional earnings reports.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While Wipro is trending upwards and has some positive developments, the news sentiment is not overwhelmingly bullish, and there are no strong catalysts to justify a BUY decision. However, the company's consistent performance and new appointments/ partnerships suggest that it's not a SELL either.
