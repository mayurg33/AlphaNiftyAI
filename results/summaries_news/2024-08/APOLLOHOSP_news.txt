Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The overall news sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with Apollo Hospitals reporting an 83% surge in Q1 net profit and strong revenue growth, beating profit estimates, driven by steady occupancy and healthy HealthCo sales. This has led to a bullish call from LKP Securities, recommending a buy on the stock.
