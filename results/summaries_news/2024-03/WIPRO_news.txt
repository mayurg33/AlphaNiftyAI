After analyzing the recent headlines about Wipro, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE.

Here's a brief summary of the news:

* Positive news: Wipro has made significant appointments, won a major contract with Desjardins, and has a positive technical chart trend. The company is also investing in growth areas like healthcare, artificial intelligence, and food space through acquisitions.
* Neutral news: The company is facing challenges, and some articles are cautioning investors to be aware of these challenges.
* No negative news: There are no recent headlines that indicate significant problems or issues with the company.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While Wipro has made some positive moves and has a strong technical chart trend, the company still faces challenges, and investors should wait for further clarity on its growth prospects before making a buying or selling decision.
