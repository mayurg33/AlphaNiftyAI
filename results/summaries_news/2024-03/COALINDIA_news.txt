Reason: The overall news sentiment is positive, with multiple headlines indicating strong production growth, new initiatives, and expanding business ventures, such as the 4,100 MW power projects in Rajasthan and the pursuit of critical minerals. This, combined with Jefferies' estimate of a potential 27% rise in share price, suggests a strong upward trend for the stock.
