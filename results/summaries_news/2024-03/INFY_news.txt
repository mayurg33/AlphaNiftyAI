Reason: While Infosys faces a tax demand of Rs 341 crore, it is also set to receive a tax refund of Rs 6,329 crore, which should offset the negative impact. Additionally, the company's recognition as one of the 2024 World's Most Ethical Companies and its partnership with a German media firm for AI-powered storytelling are positive developments, but the tepid revenue growth and Accenture's reduced revenue guidance may continue to weigh on the stock price in the short term.
