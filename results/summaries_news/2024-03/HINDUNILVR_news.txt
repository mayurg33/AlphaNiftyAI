Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While there are some positive developments such as the surge in trading volume and the company's commitment to decarbonise its supply chain, the news is largely mixed with the company evaluating options for its ice cream and Pureit businesses, which may impact its profitability. A hold decision is warranted until the outcome of these evaluations and their potential impact on the company's financials become clearer.
