Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: The recent news headlines about Axis Bank are mixed, with some positive developments such as the introduction of digital opening of US Dollar Fixed Deposits for NRI customers and investment in GMR's Delhi Airport bonds, but also some negative news like the credit card fiasco and the resignation of a group executive. Overall, the news sentiment is neutral, and therefore, it's recommended to hold the stock until further clarity emerges.
