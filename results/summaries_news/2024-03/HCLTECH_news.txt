After analyzing the recent headlines about HCLTECH, I observe a predominantly positive sentiment around the company. 

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The company's upcoming Q4 results, investments in edtech and semiconductor industries, partnership expansion with ServiceNow, and bonus issues/dividend considerations all suggest a strong business outlook, making it an attractive buy opportunity.
