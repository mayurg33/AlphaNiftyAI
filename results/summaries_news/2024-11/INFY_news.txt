Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The overall news sentiment around Infosys (INFY) is positive, with the company beating estimates in its Q2FY25 results, and its stock price rising along with other IT companies ahead of the US election outcome, driven by optimism about the sector's growth prospects. Additionally, the company's decision to give a significant bonus to its employees and its chair's bullish comments on AI adoption further support a BUY decision.
