Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The recent headlines suggest a positive sentiment around HCLTECH, with the stock surging along with other IT companies on positive market trends and US election results. Additionally, the regulatory nod for Roshni Nadar's acquisition of majority shareholding in HCLTech group firms is seen as a positive development, paving the way for the Nadar family's increased involvement in the company.
