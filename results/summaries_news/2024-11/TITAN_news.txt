After analyzing the recent headlines about Titan Company, I conclude that:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While the company's Q2 results were disappointing, with a 23-25% decline in net profit, the revenue growth of 13-25.8% YoY is a positive sign, and the long-term prospects of the jewellery business remain strong. The current sentiment is neutral, and investors should hold their positions until the company's next quarterly results provide further clarity.
