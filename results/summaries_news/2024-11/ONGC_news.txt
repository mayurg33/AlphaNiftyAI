After analyzing the recent headlines about ONGC, I summarize the overall news sentiment as Positive.

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The majority of the headlines suggest a positive outlook for ONGC, with a target price of Rs 330, a rise in Q2 net profit, and an attractive interim dividend of Rs 6 per share, which has led to a surge in the stock price, indicating a buying opportunity.
