After analyzing the recent headlines, I have concluded that the overall news sentiment for TATACONSUM is NEUTRAL to POSITIVE.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are concerns over inflation and potential price hikes in the FMCG sector, the company has a strong growth plan in place, including the scaling up of Tata Starbucks cafes and a focus on volume growth, which is likely to offset the short-term blip of food inflation.
