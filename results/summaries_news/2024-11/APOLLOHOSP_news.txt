Final Decision: BUY

Reason: The recent Q2 results of Apollo Hospitals have beaten estimates, with a 63% YoY increase in profit and a 15% increase in revenue, leading to a surge in the company's share price to a record high. This strong performance has been driven by robust demand for healthcare services, indicating a positive outlook for the company's future growth.
