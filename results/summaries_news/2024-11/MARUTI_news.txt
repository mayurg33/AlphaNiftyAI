Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: Although Maruti Suzuki's Q2FY25 results were disappointing, leading to downgrades and a decline in share price, the company's recent milestones, such as achieving 3 million car exports and reporting highest ever sales in October, suggest a strong underlying business. However, the negative financial performance in Q3 2024 and current market sentiment warrant a cautious approach, making a HOLD decision suitable for now.
