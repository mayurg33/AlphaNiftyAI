Final Decision: SELL

Reason: The overall news sentiment around Britannia Industries is bearish, with the company exiting the Nifty 50 index, its CEO resigning, and operational disruptions due to a strike at one of its plants. This combination of negative events has resulted in the stock hitting a 52-week low, suggesting a downward trend.
