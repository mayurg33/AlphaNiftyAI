Based on the recent headlines, I have summarized the overall news sentiment as follows:

* Positive sentiment: 5 articles (BusinessLine, Simply Wall Street, Mint, Business Today)
* Neutral sentiment: 2 articles (The Economic Times)
* Negative sentiment: 1 article (Business Standard, but it's about Infosys, not Divis Labs)

Final Decision: BUY
Reason: The majority of the articles have a positive sentiment towards Divis Labs, with experts recommending a "buy" rating and predicting a bullish outlook ahead, driven by its strong stock price momentum and growth potential.
