Final Decision: HOLD

Reason: While there are some positive sentiments, such as Morgan Stanley's 38% upside prediction and the launch of the new passenger vehicle portfolio in Sri Lanka, the recent slide in shares due to Trump's tariffs and uncertainty around the Tata Group IPO weigh on the stock's overall performance, making it a HOLD for now.
