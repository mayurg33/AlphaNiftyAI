After analyzing the recent headlines, I conclude that the overall news sentiment is NEUTRAL TO BEARISH.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While some brokerages remain bullish on Titan's long-term prospects, the stock has been declining due to concerns over slowing growth momentum and rich valuations, which need to be carefully monitored before making a buy or sell decision.
