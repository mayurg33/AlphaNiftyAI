After analyzing the recent headlines, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are positive developments such as Tech Mahindra's expansion in the US, successful completion of a digital transformation project, and dividend announcement, the company is also facing growth challenges and evaluation shifts, which suggest a wait-and-watch approach.
