After analyzing the recent headlines about HCLTECH, I summarize the overall news sentiment as NEUTRAL.

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While there are some positive news such as the strategic partnership with Western Union and the upcoming dividend declaration, the stock has also experienced a plunge in price and a decline in stock price following Accenture's results, indicating mixed market sentiments.
