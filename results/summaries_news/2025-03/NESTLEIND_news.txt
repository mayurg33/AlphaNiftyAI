After analyzing the recent headlines about NESTLEIND, I would suggest:

Final Decision: HOLD
Reason: While Nestle India's stock has been gaining momentum with five consecutive sessions of rises, the recent warning from SEBI for insider trading norm violations is a cause for concern, and investors should wait for further clarity on the matter before making a buying or selling decision.
