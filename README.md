# Guide for runnig the project:
Requirements-
- Python should be installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Also make sure you have VS code installed for viewing the code. Step by step guide to download VS code can be found on https://code.visualstudio.com/download

  Prerequisites for setting up the project: Git, Python (3.8+)


Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

Windows:

Also make sure you have VS Code installed, for viewing the code. For a step by step guide on how to install VS Code visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows

For a step step guide on how to install git, visit

Python and pip installation can be verified using,

python/python3 ‚Äìversion
pip/pip3 ‚Äìversion




For Linux OS (to install all prerequisites):

# Update and upgrade system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Git
sudo apt install git -y
git --version

# Install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
python3 --version
pip3 --version
sudo apt install python3.8 -y




‚Äî----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After installing the required packages, next download the code from gitHub repository


    1. Open Terminal

    2. git clone https://github.com/mayurg33/AlphaNiftyAI.git

    3. cd AlphaNiftyAI-master

    4. git checkout master

Running the code:

    1. pip install virtualenv (only first time)
    2. virtualenv venv (Creates a Virtual Environment) (only first time)
    3. ‚Äúvenv\Scripts\activate‚Äù (Activate the virtual environment) on Windows and ‚Äúsource venv/bin/activate‚Äù on Linux based OS.
    4. In case Windows shows that scripts aren‚Äôt permitted to run by this user, run the following command:

		Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUse		
    5. pip install -r "requirements.txt"
    6. If installing from requirements.txt causes any issue then, then run 
	
     pip install beautifulsoup4==4.13.4 dotenv faiss-cpu groq bnumpy openai orjson pandas playwright plotly 
     python-dotenv simplejson tqdm==4.67.1 vectorbt virtualenv yfinance==0.2.61
then run 
     playwright install
			
    7. Now we have to create an .env file, which we can do in VS Code.
    8. Run ‚Äúcode .‚Äù to open the ./backend folder in VS Code and then create a .env file in this folder
    9. If VS Code isn‚Äôt available, or if running on a linux based VM, use ‚Äúnano .env‚Äù to create the environment variable file
    10. Add these as env variables


GROQ_API_KEY=\


To make a Groq api key, visit https://console.groq.com/keys \
now open the project folder in vs code \
Though all the data is already fetch and is in the data folder yet if want to fetch then read below instructions:\
      **For fetching the monthly data go inside the monthly_llama70b folder and run : **\
     **Fundamentals data**-\
     fetch_fundamentals_loop.py\
     **Stock price data**-\
 	 fetch_price_by_month.py\
     **News-**\
	 fetch_news_playwright_loop.py\
     -Microeconomic data was manually fetched fron NSE and worldbank website\
	 **generating peer map-**\
      generate_peer_map.py\
  **for summarising:**\
   **fundamentals data:**\
   open summarixe_fundamentals_loop.py\
   paste the groq api key in client = Groq(api_key="")\
    run summarixe_fundamentals_loop.py\
   **News:**\
   open summarize_news_loop.py\
   paste the groq api key in client = Groq(api_key="")\
    run summarize_news_loop.py\
   **stock data:**\
    open summarize_price_loop.py\
    paste the groq api key in client = Groq(api_key="")\
     run summarize_price_loop.py\\

   micro economic data was summarized manually but it is in data folder\
    **For final signal genration-**\
	 run genrate_signal_confidence.py\
  
 # Evaluation for monthly strategies
 Run All the files Sarting with "MS"


 # Weekly signals
 1. Data Fetching:\
    Data is already fetched but you can run the scripts using vs code inside the src/weekly_llama70b:\
    fetch_news_weekly.py\
    fetch_weekly_fundamentals.py\
    fetch_weekly_prices.py\
    same microeconomic data was used as in monhly data. \
 3. Summarizing:\
      Though all the summaries are arleady done , if you want you can run\
